It provides software-as-a-service products related to customer support, sales, and other customer communications. The company was founded in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2007. Zendesk raised about $86 million in venture capital investments before going public in 2014.[2]\n",

            " Zendesk was founded in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2007 by three friends: Morten Primdahl, Alexander Aghassipour, and Mikkel Svane.[4][5] The founders started developing the Zendesk software in Svane's loft.[6] Initially, Zendesk was funded by the cofounders themselves, each doing consulting jobs to support their families.[6][7] Within a few months of the Zendesk software-as-a-service product being released in the fall of 2007, it had about 1,000 trial customers.[6] Initially, interest in the software spread slowly through word-of-mouth[6] predominantly among other startups.[8] Adoption accelerated in 2008, due to an increased interest in responding to customer complaints on social media and after Twitter started using Zendesk.[6]\n",
            " Venture capital investors were willing to invest in Zendesk only if the company moved to the United States,[4] where most of their customers were.[6] In 2009 Zendesk moved to Boston, Massachusetts. About six months later, they made a second move, this time to San Francisco, California.[4][9] The company raised $500,000 in seed funding, which was followed by a series A funding round for an undisclosed amount[10] and a series B round for $6 million.[6] Zendesk raised $19 million in a series C funding round in December 2010,[4] followed by $60 million in a series D funding round in 2012.[11] This brought total venture capital funding to about $86 million.[4]\n",
            " In 2010, many customers threatened to leave Zendesk in response to a substantial price increase after new features were introduced.[12] Zendesk apologized, abandoned the pricing, and promised never to change pricing on pre-existing customers for features they already have.[9] That same year, Zendesk created its first sales team.[6] Zendesk moved to larger offices in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco in 2011.[7] The city and county of San Francisco provided Zendesk with a six-year payroll tax incentive to move to the area in exchange for doing community service.[4][7]\n",
            " Zendesk grew internationally, and offices were established in Ireland, Denmark, and Australia.[4][13] In 2017, Zendesk opened an office in Singapore.[14] As of  2011[update] half of Zendesk's customers were outside the United States.[4] Although the company was not yet profitable, Zendesk's revenues grew five-fold from 2010 to 2012.[4] Revenues grew from $38 million in 2012 to $72 million in 2013.[5] Zendesk introduced its first app marketplace for third-party Zendesk software in 2012.[6] By 2013, the company had 450 employees.[6]\n",
            " In 2014, Zendesk filed an initial public offering[15] and was valued at $1.7 billion.[5] The IPO raised $100 million.[16] That same year, Zendesk announced its first acquisition.[17] It bought a live-chat company called Zopim for $29.8 million.[17] It acquired a French analytics company called BIME for $45 million.[18] It also acquired Outbound.io, which developed software to manage direct communications with customers on social media sites.[19] Additionally, Zendesk acquired Base, who developed sales automation software that competed with Salesforce.com, for $50 million.[20]\n",
            " In 2015, Zendesk filed oppositions at the United States Patent and Trademark Office to 49 trademarks including the word \"zen\". The Electronic Frontier Foundation characterized their approach of filing multiple trademark infringement lawsuits covering a wide range of businesses as trademark trolling, and EFF condemned the practice.[21][22][23]\n",
            " Initially, Zendesk's software was focused on assisting small businesses, but it transitioned to aid larger companies over time.[24][25] Zendesk also transitioned from a focus on inbound customer inquiries into communicating with customers proactively based on comments they made online.[19] In 2016, Zendesk changed its logo and rebranded to emphasize contacting customers proactively.[26] It added features that turn online reviews and comments into a customer help ticket in September 2016 and acquired Outbound.io, which helps businesses respond to online complaints in 2017.[19][27] Zendesk introduced new analytics and automation products in 2012[28] and 2016.[26] In 2016, it added features that tell customer service agents which portions of the website a customer visited before contacting customer support.[29] That same year, Zendesk added features that attempt to predict which customers are most likely to cancel their subscription service.[30]\n",
            " In 2017, Zendesk added an AI bot that has conversations with customers and attempts to direct the customer to the answer they're looking for.[31] The bot initially had limited functionality, but was expanded in 2019.[31] In 2018, the company introduced Zendesk Suite, which combines social media, live-chat, email, and other communications into a single ticket system.[32] An enterprise version of the software-as-a-service product was released in 2018.[24] By that time, 40 percent of Zendesk's revenue was coming from larger companies.[24] In 2019, Zendesk first released its \"Sunshine\" tool, which is focused on direct-messaging customers on social media sites.[33]\n",
            " Zendesk eventually expanded from just customer service to also managing other customer interactions, such as sales.[34] The company first moved into sales software with its September 2018 acquisition of competitor Base.[35][34] Base was later renamed Sell and a Sell Marketplace was created for corresponding third-party apps.[35] Part of the social media software acquired from Smooch was rebranded as Sunshine Conversations, a tool that competes with Salesforce.com.[36][37] Zendesk's sales automation software was later revamped with Zendesk Sell in 2020, which improved integration with Zendesk's customer support software.[37] Since then, Zendesk marketplace has integrated several third parties technologies to provide more services to the end customers. In 2021 for example, several companies joined Zendesk marketplace, such as Crowlingo for multilingual data collection, Verse for lead conversion and ViiBE for remote visual support.[38]\n",
            " By 2018, Zendesk had annual revenues of $500 million.[39][31]\n",
            " In July 2019, cybersecurity researcher Sam Jadali exposed a catastrophic data leak known as DataSpii.[40][41] The leak was facilitated by the marketing intelligence company Nacho Analytics (NA). Branding itself as the \"God mode for the internet,\" NA granted its members the ability to access URLs for support-ticket file attachments from Zendesk customers, including Venmo.[42][43] Importantly, due to Zendesk's default privacy settings, support-ticket file attachment URLs are publicly accessible unless customers adjust these settings for enhanced privacy.[44] The DataSpii report revealed that third parties systematically accessed URLs almost immediately after their collection, posing a threat to the confidentiality of the sensitive information contained within them.[45][46]\n",
            " In October 2019, Zendesk disclosed that it was hacked in 2016, resulting in a potential leak of information about customer service agents using Zendesk.[47]\n",
            " In May 2019, Zendesk acquired Montreal-based Smooch, for an undisclosed amount. Smooch provided messaging services on websites for live-chat customer support.[31] In 2020, Zendesk announced more tools for messaging customers on social media and enhancements to its customer relationship management features.[36][48]\n",
            " In October 2021, Zendesk announced that it was acquiring Momentive Global Inc., formerly SurveyMonkey, for $4.13 billion.[49] Zendesk's investors rejected the deal on February 25, 2022, and terminated the agreement due to risk.[50]\n",
            " In June 2022, it was announced that Zendesk would be acquired by a consortium of private-equity firms led by Permira and Hellman & Friedman in an all-cash deal worth $10.2 billion.[51] Thereafter due to the pending acquisition by these firms Zendesk neither provided shareholder's letter nor held a conference call or webcast to disclose the financial results for the third quarter ending September 30, 2022.[52]\n",
            " In September 2022, with the closure of 3rd quarter the financial results were out with a substantial increase in revenue by 20% over the year to $416.9 million and GAAP operating loss of $55.4 million with non-GAAP operating income of $48.9 million. In addition to this due to the impending transaction, Zendesk suspended its financial guidance for the fiscal year ending December 30, 2022.[52]\n",
            " In November 2022, it was announced that the investor group had completed the acquisition of Zendesk for approximately $10.2 billion.[53]\n",
            " In June 2023, Zendesk announced it had acquired Tymeshift for an undisclosed price.[54]\n",

            "  G2 CRM Connector for Salesforce enables you to map your G2 data directly to your accounts and leads in Salesforce so that you can build dashboards, create workflows, run reports and more.  G2 CRM Connector is highly customizable, and can be adapted to your specific Salesforce environment and use cases. For example, G2 CRM Connector enables you to:      G2 Buyer Intent captures enriched data about buyers researching your product across G2. Buyer Intent signals can be generated by a variety of buyer actions, including interacting with your G2 product profile page, comparing your product to a competitor, and viewing alternatives for a product in a shared category. This data enables your sales, marketing, and customer success teams to identify a buyer's stage in the buyer journey. Refer to the Buyer Intent documentation for more information on signal types, checking the signals included in your subscription, and more. G2 CRM Connector is implemented via a Salesforce managed package, which allows G2 to push updates as new features are released. G2's managed package creates 12 custom objects and 8 custom tabs in your Salesforce environment. G2 only sends data to the G2 custom objects included in the managed package. For more information, refer to the G2 custom objects and fields documentation. To realize the true value of G2 CRM Connector, you should leverage G2 custom objects throughout your Salesforce environment, such as to create reports, automations, and dashboards.  Buyer Intent signals are automatically mapped to companies in Salesforce by matching the website domain on the Buyer Intent signal to an account or lead with the same website domain in Salesforce. For more information on account mapping, refer to the Mapping G2 Buyer Intent data to Salesforce accounts and leads documentation. You must have a Salesforce Enterprise or Unlimited subscription to use G2 CRM Connector for Salesforce. Before implementing G2 CRM Connector, you should ensure that your Salesforce environment has established basic structures and workflows for managing your accounts, leads, and opportunities. This structure will be critical for mapping G2 Buyer Intent data to your workspace. You should also consider how leads are qualified, how your Marketing team determines companies to target, and how Sales prioritizes prospecting. For example, if HubSpot is going to be the primary platform where G2 data will be used in your organization, you might opt to utilize G2’s direct integration with HubSpot. For more information, on G2's integrations, refer to the Integration Hub In addition to technical documentation, G2 provides the following onboarding support for G2 CRM Connector: An experienced Salesforce admin can expect to spend 3-4 hours setting up G2 CRM Connector, including: If you encounter any issues with the integration, G2 first recommends checking the Configuration Assistant.  If you still experience issues you can contact G2 Support for issues directly related to G2 CRM Connector, including: For any of the following issues, please contact Salesforce support or review Salesforce documentation and training: You can use the examples included in the Build custom Salesforce reports with G2 data documentation as a starting point. \n",

            "  The examples shown in this documentation use Salesforce Classic. Functionality unique to Salesforce Lightning is highlighted in the Salesforce Lightning options section. The G2 Events tab enables you to view every G2 Buyer Intent event flowing into your Salesforce environment, with contextual information for each event. You can build custom views in this tab to display specific information for Buyer Intent events. Refer to the Adding G2 data to Salesforce page layouts documentation to learn how to populate Salesforce page layouts with this data. The All G2 Crowd Events view is the default experience for viewing and sorting information associated with all G2 Events. To view all events, select All G2 Crowd Events from the View dropdown, then select Go. You can sort your Buyer Intent events by selecting any of the column headers. For example, selecting Created Date orders all events by the date when the events were created. A downward-pointing arrow indicates the most recently created events are listed first.  There are three columns in this view that have underlined, selectable data: The following table identifies the tags and corresponding G2 Buyer Intent signals. Tags can be used to filter for specific signal types in Salesforce: You can create new views in the G2 Events tab to customize the information associated with your Buyer Intent events, such as the size of the buyer organization or the buyer organization’s headquarter location. The process of creating a new view shows how G2 fields can be used to create custom Salesforce reports. Unlike the views in the G2 Events tab, which you have to query manually, Salesforce reports can be exported and scheduled to run regularly. To learn more about Salesforce reports, refer to the Custom reports for Salesforce documentation. To create a new view: Go to the  G2 Events tab, then select Create New View. Enter a name for the view in the View Name field. The View Unique Name field auto-populates based on your View Name entry and does not need to be changed. Select an option for Filter By Owner: (Optional) To further narrow the reviews that will display in a view, select options for Filter by Additional Fields. For example, selecting Account and equals for the Field and Operator dropdowns, and entering a [Salesforce account name] into the Value field creates a view that only lists events  mapped to that  Salesforce account. Select an option for Restrict Visibility: Select Save. The new view is immediately available in the View dropdown for the Salesforce users within the visibility permissions set in step 6. To modify the filters included in an existing view, select the view in the View dropdown and then select Edit. You can map a G2 Event to a Salesforce account or opportunity directly from any view that includes the G2 Event Name column. Future events from the same G2 Visitor will be auto-mapped to the correct Salesforce account or opportunity. Refer to the G2 Visiting Organizations documentation for more details on mapping to this data. To map a G2 Event to an account, lead, or opportunity: You cannot create a new account or opportunity from this screen. If your account or opportunity does not appear in search, you  might need to create a new Salesforce account or opportunity before completing these steps. Refer to the Mapping Buyer Intent data to Salesforce accounts and leads documentation for more details on bulk and auto-mapping Buyer Intent signals to your accounts. You can also manually map a Buyer Intent signal to multiple Salesforce accounts. For more information on manually mapping secondary Salesforce accounts to a Buyer Intent signal, refer to G2's G2 Buyer Intent tab documentation. There are a few noteworthy differences in Salesforce Lightning that can streamline searching and sorting G2 Events. For example, if you want to view only G2 Events with a certain G2 Visitor and Country, complete the following steps: Select the funnel icon at the top-right of the G2 Events page. Select Add Filter in the filter sidebar.. Enter the following details for the G2 Visitor filter and select Done to add it: Repeat step 3 to add a Country filter with the following parameters:  You can remove a single filter by selecting the corresponding X, or remove all filters by selecting Remove All. Select Save to commit your filter changes to the G2 Events table. \n",

            "  Access to G2 CRM Connector for Salesforce must first be provisioned by your G2 representative. If you have not yet discussed G2 CRM Connector with your G2 representative, please contact them before proceeding. This page details every step you need to take to implement G2 CRM Connector for Salesforce. The full implementation process should be completed by your organization's Salesforce admin. During the implementation process, you will: Before proceeding with the following steps, make sure that you’ve received the following information from your G2 representative: Refer to the Installation URLs for G2's managed package section for more information. To implement this integration, your Salesforce user account must have a System Administrator profile.  Implementation instructions are for Salesforce Lightning. To switch from Classic to Lightning, select Switch to Lightning Experience from the header of any Salesforce page.  G2 CRM Connector is implemented via a Salesforce managed package, which allows G2 to push updates as new features are released. You might opt to demo the implementation process in a Salesforce sandbox before installing in production. G2 offers a unique managed package for both sandbox and production Salesforce environments. Production Sandbox  To install the managed package: Selecting Install for Specific Profiles enables you to assign either No Access or Full Access permission sets according to specific Salesforce profiles, such as Marketing or Sales roles, across an organization.  You should only use this if you are an experienced Salesforce admin. For more information on permission sets for the G2 CRM Connector for Salesforce, refer to step 7. Depending on your Salesforce environment, the installation process can take up to one hour. You will receive an email notification when the managed package installation is complete. G2 strongly recommends using a dedicated Integration User profile to authenticate G2's access to your Salesforce environment. While it’s possible to connect an existing user account to this integration, creating a dedicated Integration User makes it easier to troubleshoot Salesforce issues and ensures that you won’t experience any interruptions in data flow when a user leaves your organization. For more information, refer to Salesforce's The Value of Having A Dedicated Salesforce Integration User blog post. To create a dedicated Integration User:  Make sure that your team can access the email you associate with the Integration User. In the following example, we created an Integration User with the email address of sysadmins@g2.com. All other fields listed in step 3 do not impact this integration.   To assign a G2 license to the Integration User:   After assigning a G2 license, log in to the email you associated with the Integration User to access the Salesforce welcome email, then follow the prompts to set a password for your Integration User.  G2's access to update the custom objects in your Salesforce environment is authenticated by connecting the Integration User you created in the step 2. You will use the API connection URL provided by your G2 representative in this step. Your API connection URL should follow the format https://my.g2.com/salesforce_app_configurations/{product id}.  To connect G2 CRM Connector to your Salesforce environment: If your Salesforce environment uses a custom domain, you might be required to enter it before logging in.  Your custom domain precedes my.salesforce.com in the URL for your Salesforce environment. For example, in the following URL: https://empathetic-wolf-178aau-dev-ed.trailblaze.my.salesforce.com/ The custom domain is empathetic-wolf-178aau-dev-ed.trailblaze. If the Allow Access? prompt displays your Salesforce admin email instead of the Integration User email, try logging out of Salesforce, opening a new private browser window, then repeating steps 1-3. The G2 Configuration Assistant helps verify several critical steps to ensure the implementation process is successful, including: The Configuration Assistant can only be run by a Salesforce admin with the G2 Full Access permission set. If you cannot access the Configuration Assistant, refer to the Assign G2 permission set section for more information. To run the Configuration Assistant: If you were brought to a different tab, follow the troubleshooting instructions in the Configuration Assistant.   If you encounter issues at any step in the Configuration Assistant, select Contact G2 Support and describe your issue. G2's Support team will contact you for further assistance. In order for a member of your organization to access G2 data in Salesforce, they need to be assigned both a G2 CRM Connector license and a G2 permission set. You must be a Salesforce admin to assign licenses and permission sets. G2 CRM Connector includes 5,000 licenses by default. If your organization requires more licenses, please contact G2 Support for assistance.  To assign licenses to Salesforce users: You can check the number of licenses in use from the Installed Packages page.  G2 offers several permission sets to help you provide the correct access level to G2 data for different roles in your organization.  To assign G2 permission sets to Salesforce users: \n",

Creating this task ensures that account owners are aware that one of their accounts has been mapped, and that they know to follow up with the appropriate actions when targeting an account. To understand the auto-mapping and manual mapping process, refer to G2's Mapping Buyer Intent data to Salesforce accounts and leads documentation.

Once your accounts are mapped, you can add G2 Buyer Intent data to your custom Salesforce reports, dashboards, and your existing workflows, such as notifications.  To bulk map Buyer Intent data to your Salesforce accounts, refer to the Bulk mapping Buyer Intent data to Salesforce accounts documentation. The Buyer Intent tab structures data into five columns.   While Activity Level measures a buyer's total activity volume on G2, Buying Stage evaluates your buyer's journey by combining funnel-dependent factors such as page engagement and signal type. For more information, refer to the Buyer Intent documentation.  Refer to the Manually mapping individual Buyer Intent signals section for more details on bulk and auto-mapping Buyer Intent signals to your accounts To explore the Buyer Intent activity for an organization in more detail, select the organization's name Organization column.  This dropdown provides complete information about the Buyer Intent signals generated during the selected date range, including: If a Buyer Intent signal is not auto-mapped to a Salesforce account, opportunity, or lead, you can manually map it instead. By manually mapping G2 Buyer Intent data to a Salesforce account, future signals triggered by the same organization auto-map to the chosen Salesforce account. You can also manually map a Buyer Intent signal to multiple Salesforce accounts. Future Buyer Intent signals will auto-map to all of the selected accounts.  To bulk map Buyer Intent data to your Salesforce accounts, refer to the Mapping G2 Buyer Intent data to Salesforce accounts and leads documentation. To manually map G2 Buyer Intent data to an account, lead, or opportunity: To change the mapping for an account that has been previously mapped, select the edit icon.  If an account does not exist, select the create account icon  to create a new Salesforce account. This option can then be used for mapping. If no options are auto-populating Salesforce leads or opportunities, you need to create the Salesforce lead or opportunity first, and then return to the G2 Buyer Intent tab to complete the mapping process. The G2 Buyer Intent tab offers options for filtering and sorting buyer organizations. Use the search filters to find buyer organizations by firmographic criteria, activity date, and Buyer Intent score.  Search filters are dynamic, meaning selections for one filter can impact the options available in another. Search results are limited to the first 500 organizations in your chosen date range. Use the Organization Name, Company Size Minimum, and Company Size Maximum filters to target companies from a certain market segment.  You can also filter company headquarters by global and local regions.  When using geographic filters, you must select Search for each filter in order to display the correct related filters. In this example, we chose All AMER Countries > United States > California.  G2 reports two unique Buyer Intent scoring components, Buying Stage and Activity Level, for each of your buyers to provide a clear idea of where a buyer is on their journey and how to effectively engage them. While Activity Level measures a buyer's total activity volume on G2, Buying Stage evaluates your buyer's journey by incorporating funnel-dependent factors such as page engagement and Buyer Intent signal type. For more information on Buying Stage and Activity Level, refer to the Buyer Intent documentation. From the Buying Stage section, select the checkbox for each stage you want to include. From the Minimum Activity Level section, choose the lowest activity level you want to include in your results.  G2 updates Buying Stage and Activity Level daily to reflect each buyer organization’s current level of intent. Buying Stage and Activity Level are not recalculated based on your date range. You can use the Sort By dropdown to change the order of your search results.  To remove a sorting filter, select Reset Filters. \n",

            " Oracle Corporation is an American multinational computer technology company headquartered in Austin, Texas.[5] Co-founded in 1977 in Santa Clara, California, by Larry Ellison, who remains executive chairman, Oracle was the third-largest software company in the world in 2020 by revenue and market capitalization.[6] The company's 2023 ranking in the Forbes Global 2000 was 80.[7]\n",
            " The company sells database software, particularly the Oracle Database, and cloud computing. Oracle's core application software is a suite of enterprise software products, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, human capital management (HCM) software, customer relationship management (CRM) software, enterprise performance management (EPM) software, Customer Experience Commerce (CX Commerce) and supply chain management (SCM) software.[8]\n",
            " Larry Ellison, Bob Miner, and Ed Oates co-founded Oracle in 1977 in Santa Clara, California, as Software Development Laboratories (SDL).[2] Ellison took inspiration[9] from the 1970 paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database management systems (RDBMS) named \"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.\"[10] He heard about the IBM System R database from an article in the IBM Research Journal provided by Oates. Ellison wanted to make Oracle's product compatible with System R, but failed to do so as IBM kept the error codes for their DBMS a secret. SDL changed its name to Relational Software, Inc (RSI) in 1979,[11] then again to Oracle Systems Corporation in 1983,[12] to align itself more closely with its flagship product Oracle Database. The name also drew from the codename of a 1977 Central Intelligence Agency project, which was also Oracle's first customer.[13][14] At this stage, Bob Miner served as the company's senior programmer. On March 12, 1986, the company had its initial public offering.[15]\n",
            " In 1989, Oracle moved its world headquarters to the Redwood Shores neighborhood of Redwood City, California, though its campus was not completed until 1995.[16]\n",
            " In 1995, Oracle Systems Corporation changed its name to Oracle Corporation,[17] officially named Oracle, but is sometimes referred to as Oracle Corporation, the name of the holding company.[18]\n",
            " Oracle acquired the following technology companies:\n",
            " On July 15, 2013, Oracle transferred its stock listing from Nasdaq to the New York Stock Exchange. At the time, it was the largest-ever U.S. market transfer.[19]\n",
            " In an effort to compete with Amazon Web Services and its products, Oracle announced in 2019 it was partnering with former rival Microsoft. The alliance claimed that Oracle Cloud and Microsoft Azure would be directly connected, allowing customers of each to store data on both cloud computing platforms and run software on either Oracle or Azure. Some saw this not only as an attempt to compete with Amazon but also with Google and Salesforce, which acquired Looker and Tableau Software, respectively.[20]\n",
            " In December 2020, Oracle announced that it was moving its world headquarters from Redwood Shores to Austin, Texas.[21]\n",
            " In December 2021, Oracle announced the acquisition of Cerner, a health information technology company.[22] The acquisition of Cerner was completed on June 8, 2022, for US$28.3 billion in cash.[23] Also in  December 2021, Oracle announced the acquisition of Federos, an artificial intelligence (AI) and automation tools company for network performance.[24]\n",
            " In February 2023, the company announced it was going to invest $1.5 billion into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, including opening a data centre in the country's capital, Riyadh.[25]\n",
            " In April 2024, Oracle announced it was moving its world headquarters from Austin to a new complex in Nashville, Tennessee.[26] No timeframe was given.\n",
            " In June 2024, Oracle announced a $1 billion investment in Spain to enhance artificial intelligence and cloud computing. This investment will create a new cloud region in Madrid in partnership with Telefónica. The goal is to help Spanish businesses and the public sector with digital transformation and to meet European Union regulations.[27]\n",
            " In January 2025, President Donald Trump announced Stargate, a joint venture by Oracle, OpenAI, SoftBank and investment firm MGX to invest $500 billion over four years in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US.[28]\n",
            " Oracle designs, manufactures, and sells both software and hardware products and offers services that complement them (such as financing, training, consulting, and hosting services). Many of the products have been added to Oracle's portfolio through acquisitions.\n",
            " Oracle's E-delivery service (Oracle Software Delivery Cloud) provides generic downloadable Oracle software and documentation.[29]\n",
            " Oracle Corporation has acquired and developed the following additional database technologies:\n",
            " Oracle Fusion Middleware is a family of middleware software products, including (for instance) application server, system integration, business process management (BPM), user interaction, content management, identity management and business intelligence (BI) products.\n",
            " Oracle Secure Enterprise Search (SES), Oracle's enterprise-search offering, gives users the ability to search for content across multiple locations, including websites, XML files, file servers, content management systems, enterprise resource planning systems, customer relationship management systems, business intelligence systems, and databases.\n",
            " Released in 2008, the Oracle Beehive collaboration software provides team workspaces (including wikis, team calendaring and file sharing), email, calendar, instant messaging, and conferencing on a single platform. Customers can use Beehive as licensed software or as software as a service (\"SaaS\").[33]\n",
            " Following a number of acquisitions beginning in 2003, especially in the area of applications, Oracle Corporation as of 2008[update] maintains a number of product lines:\n",
            " Development of applications commonly takes place in Java (using Oracle JDeveloper) or through PL/SQL (using, for example, Oracle Forms and Oracle Reports/BIPublisher).[34][35] Oracle Corporation has started[36] a drive toward \"wizard\"-driven environments with a view to enabling non-programmers to produce simple data-driven applications.\n",
            " Oracle Corporation works with \"Oracle Certified Partners\" to enhance its overall product marketing. The variety of applications from third-party vendors includes database applications for archiving, splitting and control, ERP and CRM systems, as well as more niche and focused products providing a range of commercial functions in areas like human resources, financial control and governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC). Vendors include Hewlett-Packard, Creoal Consulting, UC4 Software,[37] Motus,[38] and Knoa Software.[39]\n",
            " Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) provides web-based monitoring and management tools for Oracle products (and for some third-party software), including database management, middleware management, application management, hardware and virtualization management and cloud management.[40]\n",
            " The Primavera products of Oracle's Construction & Engineering Global Business Unit (CEGBU) consist of project-management software.[41]\n",
            " Oracle Corporation's tools for developing applications include (among others):\n",
            " Many external and third-party tools make the Oracle database administrator's tasks easier.[42]\n",
            " Oracle Corporation develops and supports two operating systems: Oracle Solaris and Oracle Linux.\n",
            " Oracle Cloud is a cloud computing service offered by Oracle Corporation providing servers, storage, network, applications and services through a global network of Oracle Corporation managed data centers. The company allows these services to be provisioned on demand over the Internet.[48]\n",
            " Oracle Cloud provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS) and Data as a Service (DaaS). These services are used to build, deploy, integrate and extend applications in the cloud. This platform supports open standards (SQL, HTML5, REST, etc.) open-source solutions (Kubernetes, Hadoop, Kafka, etc.) and a variety of programming languages, databases, tools and frameworks including Oracle-specific, free and third-party software and systems.[49]\n",
            " On May 16, 2018, Oracle announced that it had acquired DataScience.com, a privately held cloud workspace platform for data science projects and workloads.[58]\n",
            " In 2022 Oracle shared a $9 billion contract from the United States Department of Defense for cloud computing with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.[59]\n",
            " In 1990, Oracle laid off 10% (about 400 people) of its work force because of accounting errors.[74] This crisis came about because of Oracle's \"up-front\" marketing strategy, in which sales people urged potential customers to buy the largest possible amount of software all at once. The sales people then booked the value of future license sales in the current quarter, thereby increasing their bonuses.[75] This became a problem when the future sales subsequently failed to materialize. Oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice, and also settled (out of court) class-action lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings. Ellison stated in 1992 that Oracle had made \"an incredible business mistake\".[74]\n",
            " In 1994, Informix overtook Sybase and became Oracle's most important rival. The intense war between Informix CEO Phil White and Ellison made front-page news in Silicon Valley for three years. Informix claimed that Oracle had hired away Informix engineers to disclose important trade secrets about an upcoming product. Informix finally dropped its lawsuit against Oracle in 1997.[76] In November 2005, a book detailing the war between Oracle and Informix was published, titled The Real Story of Informix Software and Phil White. It gave a detailed chronology of the battle of Informix against Oracle, and how Informix Software's CEO Phil White landed in jail because of his obsession with overtaking Ellison.\n",
            " Once it had overcome Informix and Sybase, Oracle Corporation enjoyed years of dominance in the database market until the use of Microsoft SQL Server became widespread in the late 1990s and IBM acquired Informix Software in 2001 (to complement its Db2 database). Today[update] Oracle competes for new database licenses on UNIX, GNU, and Windows operating systems primarily against IBM's Db2 and Microsoft SQL Server. IBM's Db2 still[update] dominates the mainframe database market.\n",
            " In 2004, Oracle's sales grew at a rate of 14.5% to $6.2 billion, giving it 41.3% and the top share of the relational-database market (InformationWeek – March 2005), with market share estimated at up to 44.6% in 2005 by some sources.[77]\n",
            "Oracle Corporation's main competitors in the database arena remain IBM Db2 and Microsoft SQL Server, and to a lesser extent Sybase and Teradata,[77] with free databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL also having a significant[78] share of the market. EnterpriseDB, based on PostgreSQL, has recently[update] made inroads[79] by proclaiming that its product delivers Oracle compatibility features[clarification needed] at a much lower price-point.\n",
            " In the software-applications market, Oracle Corporation primarily[80][81] competes against SAP. On March 22, 2007, Oracle sued SAP, accusing them of fraud and unfair competition.[82]\n",
            " In the market for business intelligence software, many other software companies—small and large—have successfully competed in quality with Oracle and SAP products. Business intelligence vendors can be categorized into the \"big four\" consolidated BI firms such as Oracle, who has entered BI market through a recent trend of acquisitions (including Hyperion Solutions), and the independent \"pure play\" vendors such as MicroStrategy, Actuate, and SAS.[83]\n",
            " Oracle Financials was ranked in the Top 20 Most Popular Accounting Software Infographic by Capterra in 2014, beating out SAP and a number of their other competitors.[84]\n",
            " From 1988, Oracle Corporation and the German company SAP AG had a decade-long history of cooperation, beginning with the integration of SAP's R/3 enterprise application suite with Oracle's relational database products. Despite the SAP partnership with Microsoft, and the increasing integration of SAP applications with Microsoft products (such as Microsoft SQL Server, a competitor to Oracle Database), Oracle and SAP continue their cooperation. According to Oracle Corporation, the majority of SAP's customers use Oracle databases.[85]\n",
            " In 2004, Oracle began to increase its interest in the enterprise-applications market (in 1989, Oracle had already released Oracle Financials). A series of acquisitions by Oracle Corporation began, most notably with those of PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems and Hyperion.\n",
            " SAP recognized that Oracle had started to become a competitor in a markets where SAP had the leadership, and saw an opportunity to lure in customers from those companies that Oracle Corporation had acquired. SAP would offer those customers special discounts on the licenses for its enterprise applications.\n",
            " Oracle Corporation would resort to a similar strategy, by advising SAP customers to get \"OFF SAP\" (a play on the words of the acronym for its middleware platform \"Oracle Fusion for SAP\"),[86] and also by providing special discounts on licenses and services to SAP customers who chose Oracle Corporation products.\n",
            " Currently[update] Oracle and SAP (the latter through its recently acquired subsidiary TomorrowNow) compete in the third-party enterprise software maintenance and support market. On March 22, 2007, Oracle filed a lawsuit against SAP. In Oracle Corporation v. SAP AG Oracle alleged that TomorrowNow, which provides discount support for legacy Oracle product lines, used the accounts of former Oracle customers to systematically download patches and support documents from Oracle's website and to appropriate them for SAP's use.[87] Some analysts have suggested the suit could form part of a strategy by Oracle Corporation to decrease competition with SAP in the market for third-party enterprise software maintenance and support.[88][89]\n",
            " On July 3, 2007, SAP admitted that TomorrowNow employees had made \"inappropriate downloads\" from the Oracle support website. However, it claims that SAP personnel and SAP customers had no access to Oracle intellectual property via TomorrowNow. SAP's CEO Henning Kagermann stated that \"Even a single inappropriate download is unacceptable from my perspective. We regret very much that this occurred.\" Additionally, SAP announced that it had \"instituted changes\" in TomorrowNow's operational oversight.[90]\n",
            " On November 23, 2010, a U.S. district court jury in Oakland, California, found that SAP AG must pay Oracle Corp $1.3 billion for copyright infringement, awarding damages that could be the largest-ever for copyright infringement. While admitting liability, SAP estimated the damages at no more than $40 million, while Oracle claimed that they are at least $1.65 billion. The awarded amount is one of the 10 or 20 largest jury verdicts in U.S. legal history. SAP said they were disappointed by the verdict and might appeal.[91] On September 1, 2011, a federal judge overturned the judgment and offered a reduced amount or a new trial, calling Oracle's original award \"grossly\" excessive.[92] Oracle chose a new trial.\n",
            " On August 3, 2012, SAP and Oracle agreed on a judgment for $306 million in damages, pending approval from the U.S. district court judge, \"to save time and expense of [a] new trial\". After the accord has been approved, Oracle can ask a federal appeals court to reinstate the earlier jury verdict. In addition to the damages payment, SAP has already paid Oracle $120 million for its legal fees.[93]\n",
            " Oracle Corporation produces and distributes the \"Oracle ClearView\" series of videos as part of its marketing mix.[107]\n",
            " Oracle was ranked No. 82 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[109] According to Bloomberg, Oracle's CEO-to-employee pay ratio is 1,205:1. The CEO's compensation in 2017 was $108,295,023. Oracle is one of the approved employers of ACCA and the median employee compensation rate was $89,887.[110]\n",
            " Oracle reported total carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions (direct + indirect) for the twelve months ending December 31, 2020 at 428 kilotonnes (+63/+17% year over year)[111] and plans to reduce emissions 26% by 2025 from a 2015 base year.[112]\n",
            " In 2000, Oracle attracted attention from the computer industry and the press after hiring private investigators to dig through the trash of organizations involved in an antitrust trial against Microsoft.[116] The Chairman of Oracle Corporation, Larry Ellison, staunchly defended his company's hiring of an East Coast detective agency to investigate groups that supported rival Microsoft Corporation during its antitrust trial, calling the snooping a \"public service\". The investigation reportedly included a $1,200 offer to janitors at the Association for Competitive Technology to look through Microsoft's trash. When asked how he would feel if others were looking into Oracle's business activities, Ellison said: \"We will ship our garbage to Redmond, and they can go through it. We believe in full disclosure.\"[117]\n",
            " In 2002, Oracle Corporation marketed many of its products using the slogan \"Can't break it, can't break in\", or \"Unbreakable\".[118] This signified a claim of information security. Oracle Corporation also stressed the reliability of networked databases and network access to databases as major selling points.\n",
            " However, two weeks after its introduction, David Litchfield, Alexander Kornbrust, Cesar Cerrudo and others demonstrated a whole suite of successful attacks against Oracle products.[119][120] Oracle Corporation's chief security officer Mary Ann Davidson said that, rather than representing a literal claim of Oracle's products' impregnability, she saw the campaign in the context of fourteen independent security evaluations[121] that Oracle Corporation's database server had passed.\n",
            " In 2004, then-United States Attorney General John Ashcroft sued Oracle Corporation to prevent it from acquiring a multibillion-dollar intelligence contract. After Ashcroft's resignation from government, he founded a lobbying firm, The Ashcroft Group, which Oracle hired in 2005. With the group's help, Oracle went on to acquire the contract.[122]\n",
            " Computer Sciences Corporation, as the prime contractor, reportedly spent a billion dollars developing the Expeditionary Combat Support System for the United States Air Force. It yielded no significant capability, because, according to an Air Force source, the prime contractor \"was simply not up to the task of adapting\" the Oracle software, on which the system was based, to meet the specialized performance criteria.[123]\n",
            " Oracle Corporation was awarded a contract by the State of Oregon's Oregon Health Authority (OHA) to develop Cover Oregon, the state's healthcare exchange website, as part of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. When the site tried to go live on October 1, 2013, it failed, and registrations had to be taken using paper applications until the site could be fixed.\n",
            " On April 25, 2014, the State of Oregon voted to discontinue Cover Oregon and instead use the federal exchange to enroll Oregon residents.[124] The cost of switching to the federal portal was estimated at $5 million, whereas fixing Cover Oregon would have required another $78 million.\n",
            " Oracle president Safra Catz responded to Cover Oregon and the OHA in a letter claiming that the site's problems were due to OHA mismanagement, specifically that a third-party systems integrator was not hired to manage the complex project.[125][126]\n",
            " In August 2014, Oracle Corporation sued Cover Oregon for breach of contract,[127] and then later that month the state of Oregon sued Oracle Corporation, in a civil complaint for breach of contract, fraud, filing false claims and \"racketeering\".[128] In September 2016, the two sides reached a settlement valued at over $100 million to the state, and a six-year agreement for Oracle to continue modernizing state software and IT.[129][130][131][132]\n",
            " \n",
            " In August 2022, a class action lawsuit was filed against Oracle by the law firm Lieff Cabraser. The lawsuit alleges that Oracle engaged in \"deliberate and purposeful surveillance of the general population via their digital and online existence\", specifically focusing on Oracle operating a surveillance machine which tracks in real-time and records indefinitely the personal information of hundreds of millions of people. The litigants argues that through such surveillance, the company violates the Federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act, California's state constitution, the California Invasion of Privacy Act, competition law, and California Common Law.[133][134]\n",
            " The lawsuit was settled in July 2024 when Oracle paid $115 million to some of its customers and agreed to stop tracking users.[135]\n",
            " In 2023, Oracle was contracted by conservative think tank Heritage Foundation to construct a database of conservative employees to help staff a prospective Republican presidency in 2025, part of the Foundation's Project 2025.[136][137]\n",
            " In August 2011, The Wall Street Journal reported that Oracle was being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for paying bribes to government officials in order to win business in Africa, in contravention of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).[138]\n",
            " In 2012 Oracle agreed to pay about $2 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC at the time alleged that the company's Indian subsidiary structured transactions with foreign governments in a way that enabled them to hold about $2.2 million of the proceeds inside funds that could be used for unauthorized purposes and therefore was a violation of the FCPA.[139]\n",
            " In September 2022, Oracle settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) without admitting or denying its findings, by agreeing to pay $23 million to settle the charges. The SEC announced that Oracle violated the FCPA between 2014 and 2019 when its subsidiaries in India, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) created slush funds to bribe foreign officials in order to win business.[140][141]\n",
            " In 2017, a whistleblower notified the SEC and US Department of Justice, alleging possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in awarding of a R1 billion (2015) (equivalent to R1.17 billion or US$88.54 million in 2018)[142] contract by National Treasury in 2015.[143]\n",
            " In March 2024, South Africa's Special Investigating Unit found that there were conflicts of interest, irregular processes, and non-compliance with policies and legislation, and said it would petition to blacklist Oracle in South Africa, cancel the contract and recover the money paid.[144]\n",
            " In January 2010, Oracle completed its acquisition of Sun Microsystems—valued at more than $7 billion—a move that transformed Oracle from solely a software company to a manufacturer of both software and hardware. The acquisition was delayed for several months by the European Commission because of concerns about MySQL, but was unconditionally approved in the end.[145] In September 2011, U.S. State Department Embassy cables were leaked to WikiLeaks. One cable revealed that the U.S. pressured the E.U. to allow Oracle to acquire Sun.[146]\n",
            " The Sun acquisition was closely watched by free software users and some companies, due to the fear that Oracle might end Sun's traditional support of free projects.[147][148][149][150] Since the acquisition, Oracle has discontinued OpenSolaris and StarOffice, and sued Google over the Java patents Oracle acquired from Sun.[151][152]\n",
            " On July 29, 2010, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) filed suit against Oracle Corporation alleging fraud. The lawsuit argues that the government received deals inferior to those Oracle gave to its commercial clients. The DoJ added its heft to an already existing whistleblower lawsuit filed by Paul Frascella, who was once senior director of contract services at Oracle.[153] It was settled in 2011.[154]\n",
            " Oracle, the plaintiff, acquired ownership of the Java computer programming language when it acquired Sun Microsystems in January 2010.[155] The Java software includes sets of pre-developed software code to allow programs and apps to accomplish common tasks in a consistent manner. The pre-developed code is organized into separate \"packages\" which each contain a set of \"classes\". Each class contains numerous methods, which instruct a program or app to do a certain task. Software developers \"became accustomed to using Java's designations at the package, class, and method level\".[156]\n",
            " Oracle and Google (the defendant) tried to negotiate an agreement for Oracle to license Java to Google, which would have allowed Google to use Java in developing programs for mobile devices using the Android operating system. However, the two companies never reached an agreement. After negotiations failed, Google created its own programming platform, which was based on Java, and contained 37 copied Java packages as well as new packages developed by Google.[156]\n",
            " In 2010, Oracle sued Google for copyright infringement for the use of the 37 Java packages.[156][155] The case was handled in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and assigned to Judge William Alsup (who taught himself how to code computers[157]).[155] In the lawsuit, Oracle sought between $1.4 billion and $6.1 billion.[155] In June 2011 the judge had to force Google through a judicial order to make public the details about Oracle's claim for damages.[155]\n",
            " \n",
            "By the end of the first jury trial (the legal dispute would eventually go on to another trial) the arguments made by Oracle's attorneys focused on a Java function called \"rangeCheck\": The argument centered on a function called rangeCheck. Of all the lines of code that Oracle had tested—15 million in total—these were the only ones that were 'literally' copied. Every keystroke, a perfect duplicate. – The Verge, 10/19/17[157] Although Google admitted to copying the packages, Judge Alsup found that none of the Java packages were covered under copyright protection, and therefore Google did not infringe.[156]\n",
            " After the case was over, Oracle appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (750 F.3d 1339 (2014)).[156][158] On May 9, 2014, the appeals court partially reversed Judge Alsup's decision, finding that Java APIs are copyrightable. API stands for \"application programming interface\" and are how different computer programs or apps communicate with each other. However, the appeals court also left open the possibility that Google might have a \"fair use\" defense.[158]\n",
            " On October 6, 2014, Google filed a petition to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court denied the petition.[158]\n",
            " The case was then returned to the U.S. District Court for another trial about Google's fair use defense.[158] Oracle sought $9 billion in damages.[159] In May 2016, the trial jury found that Google's use of Java's APIs was considered fair use.[158]\n",
            " In February 2017, Oracle filed another appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.[158] This time it was asking for a new trial because the District Court \"repeatedly undermined Oracle's case\", which Oracle argued led the jury to make the wrong decision. According to ZDNet, \"For example, it [Oracle] says the court wrongly bought Google's claim that Android was limited to smartphones while Java was for PCs, whereas Oracle contends that Java and Android both compete as platforms for smart TVs, cars, and wearables.\"[159]\n",
            " On August 13, 2010, an internal Oracle memo leaked to the Internet cited plans for ending the OpenSolaris operating system project and community.[160] With Oracle planning to develop Solaris only in a closed source fashion, OpenSolaris developers moved to the Illumos and OpenIndiana project, among others.[161]\n",
            " As Oracle completed their acquisition of Sun Microsystems in February 2010, they announced that OpenSSO would no longer be their strategic product.[162] Shortly after, OpenSSO was forked to OpenAM.[162] and will continue to be developed and supported by ForgeRock.\n",
            " On September 6, 2010, Oracle announced that former Hewlett-Packard CEO Mark Hurd was to replace Charles Phillips, who resigned as Oracle co-president. In an official statement made by Larry Ellison, Phillips had previously expressed his desire to transition out of the company. Ellison had asked Phillips to stay on through the integration of Sun Microsystems Inc.[163] In a separate statement regarding the transition, Ellison said \"Mark did a brilliant job at HP and I expect he'll do even better at Oracle. There is no executive in the IT world with more relevant experience than Mark.\"[164]\n",
            " On September 7, 2010, HP announced a civil lawsuit against Mark Hurd \"to protect HP's trade secrets\",[165] in response to Oracle hiring Hurd. On September 20, Oracle and HP published a joint press release announcing the resolution of the lawsuit on confidential terms and reaffirming commitment to long-term strategic partnership between the companies.[166]\n",
            " A number of OpenOffice.org developers formed The Document Foundation and received backing by Google, Novell, Red Hat, and Canonical, as well as some others, but were unable to get Oracle to donate the brand OpenOffice.org, causing a fork in the development of OpenOffice.org with the foundation now developing and promoting LibreOffice. Oracle expressed no interest in sponsoring the new project and asked the OpenOffice.org developers that started the project to resign from the company due to \"conflicts of interest\". On November 1, 2010, 33 of the OpenOffice.org developers gave their letters of resignation.[167] On June 1, 2011, Oracle donated OpenOffice.org to the Apache Software Foundation.[168]\n",
            " On June 15, 2011, HP filed a lawsuit in California Superior Court in Santa Clara, claiming that Oracle had breached an agreement to support the Itanium microprocessor used in HP's high-end enterprise servers.[169] Oracle called the lawsuit \"an abuse of the judicial process\"[170] and said that had it known SAP's Léo Apotheker was about to be hired as HP's new CEO, any support for HP's Itanium servers would not have been implied.[171]\n",
            " On August 1, 2012, a California judge said in a tentative ruling that Oracle must continue porting its software at no cost until HP discontinues its sales of Itanium-based servers.[172][173] HP was awarded $3 billion in damages against Oracle in 2016.[174] HP argued Oracle's canceling support damaged HP's Itanium server brand. Oracle had announced that it would appeal both the decision and damages, but the decision stayed.[175][176]\n",
            " On April 20, 2012, the US General Services Administration banned Oracle from the most popular portal for bidding on GSA contracts for undisclosed reasons. Oracle has previously used this portal for around four hundred million dollars a year in revenue.[177] Oracle previously settled a lawsuit filed under the False Claims Act, which accused the company of overbilling the US government between 1998 and 2006. The 2011 settlement forced Oracle to pay $199.5 million to the General Services Administration.[178]\n",
            " On December 20, 2021, Oracle announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Cerner Corporation (now Oracle Health and Oracle Life Sciences) for approximately US$28.3 billion, creating a dedicated Industry Business Unit within the company. Cerner is the largest international supplier of health information technology, such as electronic health records (EHR), revenue cycle solutions, and biomedical device integration platforms, and has its headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri, US.[179] The deal closed in early July 2022 after receiving final approval from European regulators, making it Oracle's largest acquisition and one of the largest in corporate history.[180]\n",
            " Oracle's purchase of Cerner is part of an effort to introduce Oracle products into the healthcare market, particularly in the United States although Oracle plans to expand Cerner's global operations.[180] It mirrors closely to expansions of other large information technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon into the healthcare sector. Cerner already used Oracle solutions for its \"largest business and most important clinical system\", and Oracle announced its intention to integrate autonomous solutions such as the Oracle Voice Digital Assistant into Cerner clinical solutions. Oracle additionally has shared its plans to improve the usability and user experience of Cerner solutions.[179]\n",
            " While the acquisition was originally met with mixed reactions by industry and investors, some industry experts have developed a more positive perception of the purchase. Cerner won a major contract in 2017 to supply its EHR software to the US Department of Defense and Veterans Administration Hospitals, which resulted in Cerner \"leaving its traditional base of hospital systems high and dry\" with delays in resolving issues and implementing innovations. Oracle's acquisition allows for the larger corporation to support Cerner's operations, with the goal of \"addressing basic operational issues... improving resiliency and usability\" in the short-term.[181] Some opinions have expressed longer-term concern, with Oracle Health expecting a decline in US-based sales in 2024, although an increase in global sales. Additionally, clients of Cerner have reported minimal improvements to the core system and a focus by Oracle on future advancements over resolving current issues.[182]\n",
            " A September 2024 announcement by Oracle listed \"tens of thousands of engineering hours and millions of dollars\" of investments in the core clinical operations, and the release of the highly anticipated Oracle Clinical Digital Assistant, a generative AI system that automatically creates consultation documentation and proposes orders.[183]\n",
            " On September 13, 2020, Bloomberg News reported that Oracle won a bidding war with other U.S.-based companies to take over social media company TikTok's operations in the United States following the company's pressure to forcibly be shut down by the Trump administration. Oracle was described as a \"trusted tech partner\" by TikTok, suggesting the deal may not be as structured as an outright sale.[184] On September 19, 2020, the Trump administration approved of the sale of TikTok's US operations to Oracle \"[delaying] — by one week — restrictions that were originally to take effect\" on September 20 as indicated by the United States Department of Commerce.[185]\n",
            " On February 10, 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing a source familiar with the matter, the Biden administration would be backing off from banning TikTok and shelving the sale of TikTok indefinitely, as the U.S. Commerce Department began reviewing whether or not Trump's claims about TikTok can justify the attempts to ban it.[186]\n",
            "On February 27, 2023, Biden changed his \"indefinite\" stance on TikTok as he echoed Trump's 2020 claims of disapproval. Biden said Federal agencies have thirty days to remove TikTok from all federal devices. Federal contractors must meet the same standard in ninety days. On March 8, 2024, Biden said he would sign a bipartisan bill banning TikTok in the United States if the Chinese company ByteDance didn't divest.\n",

This complex was home to Oracle world headquarters from 1989 to 2020.  It is located on the former site of Marine World/Africa USA, which moved from Redwood Shores to Vallejo in 1986. Oracle Corporation originally leased two buildings on the Oracle Parkway site, moving its finance and administration departments from the corporation's former headquarters on Davis Drive, Belmont, California. Eventually, Oracle purchased the complex and constructed four additional buildings.\n",

And really, it was more of a kitchen table. A lot of beer was spilled on it. \\n This article describes how to view customer context in the context panel, including\\n      additional user profiles and events from applications other than Zendesk. You must have the\\n        Agent Workspace to use the context panel. This article includes the following sections: Related articles To provide better, faster, and more personalized responses to customers, you can view\\n        customer context in a ticket. By default, customer context includes:  Additionally, if enabled by your administrator, customer context can include\\n        additional user profiles and interaction history (events) from applications other than\\n        Zendesk. When viewing a ticket , you can open the customer context panel to view more\\n        information about the support requester. The conext panel is closed by default. To view customer context  The user essentials card displays basic profile information about the ticket\\n        requester, including user name, contact information, social identities, organization\\n        membership, time zone, and preferred language.  You can make basic updates to the\\n          user essentials card. If allowed by an account administrator, you can also view the requester’s additional user\\n          profiles for integrated third-party applications. (Professional plans and above) If configured by an admin, the user essentials card may display\\n        additional information about the ticket requester. This information can include additional\\n        contact information, or custom fields, such as a membership ID.  You can update the user essentials card by adding a note, or editing the requester’s\\n          Zendesk user profile. To add a note to the user essentials card To edit the requester\\'s profile Depending on which applications your account supports, your customers may have\\n          more than one user profile. For example, your customer may have a Shopify user profile in\\n          addition to their Zendesk user profile. To help you resolve customer issues, it can be\\n          useful for you to see each profile. This option is only available if enabled by an account administrator.  To switch between profiles    Interactions list the requester’s recent Zendesk user events, as well as events for any\\n        other integrated applications. You can view or\\n          preview the tickets in this list, and filter the interactions to locate specific\\n        events.   If a ticket\\n              displays the subject \"Incident,\" this means that the ticket was created with no\\n              subject. Your customers may have interactions for more than one application. To help you resolve\\n          customer issues, it can be useful for you to filter user events by application or event\\n          type. To filter interaction events   You can view: Customer context also includes Pages viewed (also called visitor path), which\\n        displays the 20 most-recent web pages, app screens, or help center articles viewed by the\\n        requester. Tracking begins when an end user first lands on any page with a Web Widget or\\n        mobile SDK embedded in it, and only pages with a widget or SDK embedded are recorded. The\\n        list is updated in real time – it shows what the requester is currently viewing, and updates\\n        if they move to another page, screen, or article. The chat visitor path persists only while a chat session is active. This is because the\\n        visitor path loses significance when a chat session ends. In Messaging, the visitor path\\n        persists across sessions.\\n        \\n       To view the pages viewed list This displays the web pages, app screens, or help center articles the\\n            requester has viewed, including what the requester is currently viewing, that meet the\\n            criteria listed above.  The Chat path may also display a warning banner, alerting the agent to a discrepancy\\n          between the visitor\\'s existing profile and the data collected in a pre-chat form. This\\n          banner is informational-only. See Understanding the warning banner in the customer context panel\\n          for more information. When the device information activated in the Agent Workspace, agents can view it\\n        in the customer context in the context panel. Device information is view only.

It provides software-as-a-service products related to customer support, sales, and other customer communications. The company was founded in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2007. Zendesk raised about $86 million in venture capital investments before going public in 2014.[2]\\n On November 22, 2022, Zendesk announced that it had been acquired by a group of investors led by Hellman & Friedman and Permira for approximately $10.2 billion.[3]\\n Zendesk was founded in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2007 by three friends: Morten Primdahl, Alexander Aghassipour, and Mikkel Svane.[4][5] The founders started developing the Zendesk software in Svane\\'s loft.[6] Initially, Zendesk was funded by the cofounders themselves, each doing consulting jobs to support their families.[6][7] Within a few months of the Zendesk software-as-a-service product being released in the fall of 2007, it had about 1,000 trial customers.[6] Initially, interest in the software spread slowly through word-of-mouth[6] predominantly among other startups.[8] Adoption accelerated in 2008, due to an increased interest in responding to customer complaints on social media and after Twitter started using Zendesk.[6]\\n Venture capital investors were willing to invest in Zendesk only if the company moved to the United States,[4] where most of their customers were.[6] In 2009 Zendesk moved to Boston, Massachusetts. About six months later, they made a second move, this time to San Francisco, California.[4][9] The company raised $500,000 in seed funding, which was followed by a series A funding round for an undisclosed amount[10] and a series B round for $6 million.[6] Zendesk raised $19 million in a series C funding round in December 2010,[4] followed by $60 million in a series D funding round in 2012.[11] This brought total venture capital funding to about $86 million.[4]\\n In 2010, many customers threatened to leave Zendesk in response to a substantial price increase after new features were introduced.[12] Zendesk apologized, abandoned the pricing, and promised never to change pricing on pre-existing customers for features they already have.[9] That same year, Zendesk created its first sales team.[6] Zendesk moved to larger offices in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco in 2011.[7] The city and county of San Francisco provided Zendesk with a six-year payroll tax incentive to move to the area in exchange for doing community service.[4][7]\\n Zendesk grew internationally, and offices were established in Ireland, Denmark, and Australia.[4][13] In 2017, Zendesk opened an office in Singapore.[14] As of \\xa02011[update] half of Zendesk\\'s customers were outside the United States.[4] Although the company was not yet profitable, Zendesk\\'s revenues grew five-fold from 2010 to 2012.[4] Revenues grew from $38 million in 2012 to $72 million in 2013.[5] Zendesk introduced its first app marketplace for third-party Zendesk software in 2012.[6] By 2013, the company had 450 employees.[6]\\n In 2014, Zendesk filed an initial public offering[15] and was valued at $1.7 billion.[5] The IPO raised $100 million.[16] That same year, Zendesk announced its first acquisition.[17] It bought a live-chat company called Zopim for $29.8 million.[17] It acquired a French analytics company called BIME for $45 million.[18] It also acquired Outbound.io, which developed software to manage direct communications with customers on social media sites.[19] Additionally, Zendesk acquired Base, who developed sales automation software that competed with Salesforce.com, for $50 million.[20]\\n In 2015, Zendesk filed oppositions at the United States Patent and Trademark Office to 49 trademarks including the word \"zen\". The Electronic Frontier Foundation characterized their approach of filing multiple trademark infringement lawsuits covering a wide range of businesses as trademark trolling, and EFF condemned the practice.[21][22][23]\\n Initially, Zendesk\\'s software was focused on assisting small businesses, but it transitioned to aid larger companies over time.[24][25] Zendesk also transitioned from a focus on inbound customer inquiries into communicating with customers proactively based on comments they made online.[19] In 2016, Zendesk changed its logo and rebranded to emphasize contacting customers proactively.[26] It added features that turn online reviews and comments into a customer help ticket in September 2016 and acquired Outbound.io, which helps businesses respond to online complaints in 2017.[19][27] Zendesk introduced new analytics and automation products in 2012[28] and 2016.[26] In 2016, it added features that tell customer service agents which portions of the website a customer visited before contacting customer support.[29] That same year, Zendesk added features that attempt to predict which customers are most likely to cancel their subscription service.[30]\\n In 2017, Zendesk added an AI bot that has conversations with customers and attempts to direct the customer to the answer they\\'re looking for.[31] The bot initially had limited functionality, but was expanded in 2019.[31] In 2018, the company introduced Zendesk Suite, which combines social media, live-chat, email, and other communications into a single ticket system.[32] An enterprise version of the software-as-a-service product was released in 2018.[24] By that time, 40 percent of Zendesk\\'s revenue was coming from larger companies.[24] In 2019, Zendesk first released its \"Sunshine\" tool, which is focused on direct-messaging customers on social media sites.[33]\\n Zendesk eventually expanded from just customer service to also managing other customer interactions, such as sales.[34] The company first moved into sales software with its September 2018 acquisition of competitor Base.[35][34] Base was later renamed Sell and a Sell Marketplace was created for corresponding third-party apps.[35] Part of the social media software acquired from Smooch was rebranded as Sunshine Conversations, a tool that competes with Salesforce.com.[36][37] Zendesk\\'s sales automation software was later revamped with Zendesk Sell in 2020, which improved integration with Zendesk\\'s customer support software.[37] Since then, Zendesk marketplace has integrated several third parties technologies to provide more services to the end customers. In 2021 for example, several companies joined Zendesk marketplace, such as Crowlingo for multilingual data collection, Verse for lead conversion and ViiBE for remote visual support.[38]\\n By 2018, Zendesk had annual revenues of $500 million.[39][31]\\n In July 2019, cybersecurity researcher Sam Jadali exposed a catastrophic data leak known as DataSpii.[40][41] The leak was facilitated by the marketing intelligence company Nacho Analytics (NA). Branding itself as the \"God mode for the internet,\" NA granted its members the ability to access URLs for support-ticket file attachments from Zendesk customers, including Venmo.[42][43] Importantly, due to Zendesk\\'s default privacy settings, support-ticket file attachment URLs are publicly accessible unless customers adjust these settings for enhanced privacy.[44] The DataSpii report revealed that third parties systematically accessed URLs almost immediately after their collection, posing a threat to the confidentiality of the sensitive information contained within them.[45][46]\\n In October 2019, Zendesk disclosed that it was hacked in 2016, resulting in a potential leak of information about customer service agents using Zendesk.[47]\\n In May 2019, Zendesk acquired Montreal-based Smooch, for an undisclosed amount. Smooch provided messaging services on websites for live-chat customer support.[31] In 2020, Zendesk announced more tools for messaging customers on social media and enhancements to its customer relationship management features.[36][48]\\n In October 2021, Zendesk announced that it was acquiring Momentive Global Inc., formerly SurveyMonkey, for $4.13 billion.[49] Zendesk\\'s investors rejected the deal on February 25, 2022, and terminated the agreement due to risk.[50]\\n In June 2022, it was announced that Zendesk would be acquired by a consortium of private-equity firms led by Permira and Hellman & Friedman in an all-cash deal worth $10.2 billion.[51] Thereafter due to the pending acquisition by these firms Zendesk neither provided shareholder\\'s letter nor held a conference call or webcast to disclose the financial results for the third quarter ending September 30, 2022.[52]\\n In September 2022, with the closure of 3rd quarter the financial results were out with a substantial increase in revenue by 20% over the year to $416.9 million and GAAP operating loss of $55.4 million with non-GAAP operating income of $48.9 million. In addition to this due to the impending transaction, Zendesk suspended its financial guidance for the fiscal year ending December 30, 2022.[52]\\n In November 2022, it was announced that the investor group had completed the acquisition of Zendesk for approximately $10.2 billion.[53]\\n In June 2023, Zendesk announced it had acquired Tymeshift for an undisclosed price.[54]\\n\\n', 'Salesforce is the world’s leading customer relationship management  technology (What is CRM?), helping you build and improve your customer relationships.

G2 CRM Connector is highly customizable, and can be adapted to your specific Salesforce environment and use cases. For example, G2 CRM Connector enables you to:      G2 Buyer Intent captures enriched data about buyers researching your product across G2. Buyer Intent signals can be generated by a variety of buyer actions, including interacting with your G2 product profile page, comparing your product to a competitor, and viewing alternatives for a product in a shared category. This data enables your sales, marketing, and customer success teams to identify a buyer\\'s stage in the buyer journey. Refer to the Buyer Intent documentation for more information on signal types, checking the signals included in your subscription, and more. G2 CRM Connector is implemented via a Salesforce managed package, which allows G2 to push updates as new features are released. G2\\'s managed package creates 12 custom objects and 8 custom tabs in your Salesforce environment. G2 only sends data to the G2 custom objects included in the managed package. For more information, refer to the G2 custom objects and fields documentation. To realize the true value of G2 CRM Connector, you should leverage G2 custom objects throughout your Salesforce environment, such as to create reports, automations, and dashboards.  Buyer Intent signals are automatically mapped to companies in Salesforce by matching the website domain on the Buyer Intent signal to an account or lead with the same website domain in Salesforce. For more information on account mapping, refer to the Mapping G2 Buyer Intent data to Salesforce accounts and leads documentation. You must have a Salesforce Enterprise or Unlimited subscription to use G2 CRM Connector for Salesforce. Before implementing G2 CRM Connector, you should ensure that your Salesforce environment has established basic structures and workflows for managing your accounts, leads, and opportunities. This structure will be critical for mapping G2 Buyer Intent data to your workspace. You should also consider how leads are qualified, how your Marketing team determines companies to target, and how Sales prioritizes prospecting. For example, if HubSpot is going to be the primary platform where G2 data will be used in your organization, you might opt to utilize G2’s direct integration with HubSpot. For more information, on G2\\'s integrations, refer to the Integration Hub In addition to technical documentation, G2 provides the following onboarding support for G2 CRM Connector: An experienced Salesforce admin can expect to spend 3-4 hours setting up G2 CRM Connector, including: If you encounter any issues with the integration, G2 first recommends checking the Configuration Assistant.  If you still experience issues you can contact G2 Support for issues directly related to G2 CRM Connector, including: For any of the following issues, please contact Salesforce support or review Salesforce documentation and training: You can use the examples included in the Build custom Salesforce reports with G2 data documentation as a starting point. \\nTable of contents\\n We use cookies to enhance the functionality of our site and conduct anonymous analytics.

Functionality unique to Salesforce Lightning is highlighted in the Salesforce Lightning options section. The G2 Events tab enables you to view every G2 Buyer Intent event flowing into your Salesforce environment, with contextual information for each event. You can build custom views in this tab to display specific information for Buyer Intent events. Refer to the Adding G2 data to Salesforce page layouts documentation to learn how to populate Salesforce page layouts with this data. The All G2 Crowd Events view is the default experience for viewing and sorting information associated with all G2 Events. To view all events, select All G2 Crowd Events from the View dropdown, then select Go. You can sort your Buyer Intent events by selecting any of the column headers. For example, selecting Created Date orders all events by the date when the events were created. A downward-pointing arrow indicates the most recently created events are listed first.  There are three columns in this view that have underlined, selectable data: The following table identifies the tags and corresponding G2 Buyer Intent signals. Tags can be used to filter for specific signal types in Salesforce: You can create new views in the G2 Events tab to customize the information associated with your Buyer Intent events, such as the size of the buyer organization or the buyer organization’s headquarter location. The process of creating a new view shows how G2 fields can be used to create custom Salesforce reports. Unlike the views in the G2 Events tab, which you have to query manually, Salesforce reports can be exported and scheduled to run regularly. To learn more about Salesforce reports, refer to the Custom reports for Salesforce documentation. To create a new view: Go to the  G2 Events tab, then select Create New View. Enter a name for the view in the View Name field. The View Unique Name field auto-populates based on your View Name entry and does not need to be changed. Select an option for Filter By Owner: (Optional) To further narrow the reviews that will display in a view, select options for Filter by Additional Fields. For example, selecting Account and equals for the Field and Operator dropdowns, and entering a [Salesforce account name] into the Value field creates a view that only lists events  mapped to that  Salesforce account. Select an option for Restrict Visibility: Select Save. The new view is immediately available in the View dropdown for the Salesforce users within the visibility permissions set in step 6. To modify the filters included in an existing view, select the view in the View dropdown and then select Edit. You can map a G2 Event to a Salesforce account or opportunity directly from any view that includes the G2 Event Name column. Future events from the same G2 Visitor will be auto-mapped to the correct Salesforce account or opportunity. Refer to the G2 Visiting Organizations documentation for more details on mapping to this data. To map a G2 Event to an account, lead, or opportunity: You cannot create a new account or opportunity from this screen. If your account or opportunity does not appear in search, you  might need to create a new Salesforce account or opportunity before completing these steps. Refer to the Mapping Buyer Intent data to Salesforce accounts and leads documentation for more details on bulk and auto-mapping Buyer Intent signals to your accounts. You can also manually map a Buyer Intent signal to multiple Salesforce accounts. For more information on manually mapping secondary Salesforce accounts to a Buyer Intent signal, refer to G2\\'s G2 Buyer Intent tab documentation. There are a few noteworthy differences in Salesforce Lightning that can streamline searching and sorting G2 Events. For example, if you want to view only G2 Events with a certain G2 Visitor and Country, complete the following steps: Select the funnel icon at the top-right of the G2 Events page. Select Add Filter in the filter sidebar.. Enter the following details for the G2 Visitor filter and select Done to add it: Repeat step 3 to add a Country filter with the following parameters:  You can remove a single filter by selecting the corresponding X, or remove all filters by selecting Remove All. Select Save to commit your filter changes to the G2 Events table. \\nInhaltsverzeichnis\\n We use cookies to enhance the functionality of our site and conduct anonymous analytics.

If you have not yet discussed G2 CRM Connector with\\xa0your G2 representative, please contact them before proceeding. This page details every step you need to take to implement G2 CRM Connector for Salesforce. The full implementation process should be completed by your organization\\'s Salesforce admin. During the implementation process, you will: Before proceeding with the following steps, make sure that you’ve received the following information from your G2 representative: Refer to the Installation URLs for G2\\'s managed package section for more information. To implement this integration, your Salesforce user account must have a System Administrator profile.  Implementation instructions are for Salesforce Lightning. To switch from Classic to Lightning, select Switch to Lightning Experience from the header of any Salesforce page.  G2 CRM Connector is implemented via a Salesforce managed package, which allows G2 to push updates as new features are released. You might opt to demo the implementation process in a Salesforce sandbox before installing in production. G2 offers a unique managed package for both sandbox and production Salesforce environments. Production Sandbox  To install the managed package: Selecting Install for Specific Profiles enables you to assign either No Access or Full Access permission sets according to specific Salesforce profiles, such as Marketing or Sales roles, across an organization.  You should only use this if you are an experienced Salesforce admin. For more information on permission sets for the G2 CRM Connector for Salesforce, refer to step 7. Depending on your Salesforce environment, the installation process can take up to one hour. You will receive an email notification when the managed package installation is complete. G2 strongly recommends using a dedicated Integration User profile to authenticate G2\\'s access to your Salesforce environment. While it’s possible to connect an existing user account to this integration, creating a dedicated Integration User makes it easier to troubleshoot Salesforce issues and ensures that you won’t experience any interruptions in data flow when a user leaves your organization. For more information, refer to Salesforce\\'s The Value of Having A Dedicated Salesforce Integration User blog post. To create a dedicated Integration User:  Make sure that your team can access the email you associate with the Integration User. In the following example, we created an Integration User with the email address of sysadmins@g2.com. All other fields listed in step 3 do not impact this integration.   To assign a G2 license to the Integration User:   After assigning a G2 license, log in to the email you associated with the Integration User to access the Salesforce welcome email, then follow the prompts to set a password for your Integration User.  G2\\'s access to update the custom objects in your Salesforce environment is authenticated by connecting the Integration User you created in the step 2. You will use the API connection URL provided by your G2 representative in this step. Your API connection URL should follow the format https://my.g2.com/salesforce_app_configurations/{product id}.  To connect G2 CRM Connector to your Salesforce environment: If your Salesforce environment uses a custom domain, you might be required to enter it before logging in.  Your custom domain precedes my.salesforce.com in the URL for your Salesforce environment. For example, in the following URL: https://empathetic-wolf-178aau-dev-ed.trailblaze.my.salesforce.com/ The custom domain is empathetic-wolf-178aau-dev-ed.trailblaze. If the Allow Access? prompt displays your Salesforce admin email instead of the Integration User email, try logging out of Salesforce, opening a new private browser window, then repeating steps 1-3. The G2 Configuration Assistant helps verify several critical steps to ensure the implementation process is successful, including: The Configuration Assistant can only be run by a Salesforce admin with the G2 Full Access permission set. If you cannot access the Configuration Assistant, refer to the Assign G2 permission set section for more information. To run the Configuration Assistant: If you were brought to a different tab, follow the troubleshooting instructions in the Configuration Assistant.   If you encounter issues at any step in the Configuration Assistant, select Contact G2 Support and describe your issue. G2\\'s Support team will contact you for further assistance. In order for a member of your organization to access G2 data in Salesforce, they need to be assigned both a G2 CRM Connector license and a G2 permission set. You must be a Salesforce admin to assign licenses and permission sets. G2 CRM Connector includes 5,000 licenses by default. If your organization requires more licenses, please contact G2 Support for assistance.  To assign licenses to Salesforce users: You can check the number of licenses in use from the Installed Packages page.  G2 offers several permission sets to help you provide the correct access level to G2 data for different roles in your organization.

Once your accounts are mapped, you can add G2 Buyer Intent data to your custom Salesforce reports, dashboards, and your existing workflows, such as notifications.  To bulk map Buyer Intent data to your Salesforce accounts, refer to the Bulk mapping Buyer Intent data to Salesforce accounts documentation. The Buyer Intent tab structures data into five columns.   While Activity Level measures a buyer\\'s total activity volume on G2, Buying Stage evaluates your buyer\\'s journey by combining funnel-dependent factors such as page engagement and signal type. For more information, refer to the Buyer Intent documentation.  Refer to the Manually mapping individual Buyer Intent signals section for more details on bulk and auto-mapping Buyer Intent signals to your accounts To explore the Buyer Intent activity for an organization in more detail, select the organization\\'s name Organization column.  This dropdown provides complete information about the Buyer Intent signals generated during the selected date range, including: If a Buyer Intent signal is not auto-mapped to a Salesforce account, opportunity, or lead, you can manually map it instead. By manually mapping G2 Buyer Intent data to a Salesforce account, future signals triggered by the same organization auto-map to the chosen Salesforce account. You can also manually map a Buyer Intent signal to multiple Salesforce accounts. Future Buyer Intent signals will auto-map to all of the selected accounts.  To bulk map Buyer Intent data to your Salesforce accounts, refer to the Mapping G2 Buyer Intent data to Salesforce accounts and leads documentation. To manually map G2 Buyer Intent data to an account, lead, or opportunity: To change the mapping for an account that has been previously mapped, select the edit icon.  If an account does not exist, select the create account icon  to create a new Salesforce account. This option can then be used for mapping. If no options are auto-populating Salesforce leads or opportunities, you need to create the Salesforce lead or opportunity first, and then return to the G2 Buyer Intent tab to complete the mapping process. The G2 Buyer Intent tab offers options for filtering and sorting buyer organizations. Use the search filters to find buyer organizations by firmographic criteria, activity date, and Buyer Intent score.  Search filters are dynamic, meaning selections for one filter can impact the options available in another. Search results are limited to the first 500 organizations in your chosen date range. Use the Organization Name, Company Size Minimum, and Company Size Maximum filters to target companies from a certain market segment.  You can also filter company headquarters by global and local regions.  When using geographic filters, you must select Search for each filter in order to display the correct related filters. In this example, we chose All AMER Countries > United States > California.  G2 reports two unique Buyer Intent scoring components, Buying Stage and Activity Level, for each of your buyers to provide a clear idea of where a buyer is on their journey and how to effectively engage them. While Activity Level measures a buyer\\'s total activity volume on G2, Buying Stage evaluates your buyer\\'s journey by incorporating funnel-dependent factors such as page engagement and Buyer Intent signal type. For more information on Buying Stage and Activity Level, refer to the Buyer Intent documentation. From the Buying Stage section, select the checkbox for each stage you want to include. From the Minimum Activity Level section, choose the lowest activity level you want to include in your results.  G2 updates Buying Stage and Activity Level daily to reflect each buyer organization’s current level of intent. Buying Stage and Activity Level are not recalculated based on your date range. You can use the Sort By dropdown to change the order of your search results.  To remove a sorting filter, select Reset Filters. \\nTable of contents\\n We use cookies to enhance the functionality of our site and conduct anonymous analytics.

Oracle ranks as the world’s largest database management company with US$100M in sales and 4,500 end users in 55 countries. Oracle debuts on the S&P 500, outgrows its old headquarters, and moves to Redwood Shores, California. There’s lots to celebrate with the release of the game-changing Oracle7 database and the company’s 15th anniversary. CEO Larry Ellison introduces a product strategy for delivering Oracle software via the internet. InformationWeek names Oracle Database one of the most influential products of the 1990s. Oracle saves US$1B dollars consolidating its own systems using Oracle E-Business Suite 11i, the first fully integrated enterprise apps suite. Oracle kicks off a Silicon Valley high-tech acquisition trend by buying a leader in HR and ERP apps. Oracle turns 30, with revenues of US$18B, 65,000 employees, and 275,000 customers in more than 145 countries. Oracle acquires Sun Microsystems, cementing its strategy to engineer hardware and software together, and also becomes the steward of Java. The industry\\'s most complete suite of enterprise SaaS applications is built from the ground up for the cloud. Revolutionary multitenant architecture helps deliver a secure and consolidated database cloud.

Relying on Oracle Cloud to power its race strategy, fan engagement, and more, Oracle Red Bull Racing defends its F1 World Drivers’ Championship and wins the Constructors’ World Championship. The 23ai version comes with AI Vector Search and hundreds of other new features.\\n\\n Oracle Corporation is an American multinational computer technology company headquartered in Austin, Texas.[5] Co-founded in 1977 in Santa Clara, California, by Larry Ellison, who remains executive chairman, Oracle was the third-largest software company in the world in 2020 by revenue and market capitalization.[6] The company\\'s 2023 ranking in the Forbes Global 2000 was 80.[7]\\n The company sells database software, particularly the Oracle Database, and cloud computing. Oracle\\'s core application software is a suite of enterprise software products, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, human capital management (HCM) software, customer relationship management (CRM) software, enterprise performance management (EPM) software, Customer Experience Commerce (CX Commerce) and supply chain management (SCM) software.[8]\\n Larry Ellison, Bob Miner, and Ed Oates co-founded Oracle in 1977 in Santa Clara, California, as Software Development Laboratories (SDL).[2] Ellison took inspiration[9] from the 1970 paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database management systems (RDBMS) named \"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.\"[10] He heard about the IBM System R database from an article in the IBM Research Journal provided by Oates. Ellison wanted to make Oracle\\'s product compatible with System R, but failed to do so as IBM kept the error codes for their DBMS a secret. SDL changed its name to Relational Software, Inc (RSI) in 1979,[11] then again to Oracle Systems Corporation in 1983,[12] to align itself more closely with its flagship product Oracle Database. The name also drew from the codename of a 1977 Central Intelligence Agency project, which was also Oracle\\'s first customer.[13][14] At this stage, Bob Miner served as the company\\'s senior programmer. On March 12, 1986, the company had its initial public offering.[15]\\n In 1989, Oracle moved its world headquarters to the Redwood Shores neighborhood of Redwood City, California, though its campus was not completed until 1995.[16]\\n In 1995, Oracle Systems Corporation changed its name to Oracle Corporation,[17] officially named Oracle, but is sometimes referred to as Oracle Corporation, the name of the holding company.[18]\\n Oracle acquired the following technology companies:\\n On July 15, 2013, Oracle transferred its stock listing from Nasdaq to the New York Stock Exchange. At the time, it was the largest-ever U.S. market transfer.[19]\\n In an effort to compete with Amazon Web Services and its products, Oracle announced in 2019 it was partnering with former rival Microsoft. The alliance claimed that Oracle Cloud and Microsoft Azure would be directly connected, allowing customers of each to store data on both cloud computing platforms and run software on either Oracle or Azure. Some saw this not only as an attempt to compete with Amazon but also with Google and Salesforce, which acquired Looker and Tableau Software, respectively.[20]\\n In December 2020, Oracle announced that it was moving its world headquarters from Redwood Shores to Austin, Texas.[21]\\n In December 2021, Oracle announced the acquisition of Cerner, a health information technology company.[22] The acquisition of Cerner was completed on June 8, 2022, for US$28.3 billion in cash.[23] Also in  December 2021, Oracle announced the acquisition of Federos, an artificial intelligence (AI) and automation tools company for network performance.[24]\\n In February 2023, the company announced it was going to invest $1.5 billion into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, including opening a data centre in the country\\'s capital, Riyadh.[25]\\n In April 2024, Oracle announced it was moving its world headquarters from Austin to a new complex in Nashville, Tennessee.[26] No timeframe was given.\\n In June 2024, Oracle announced a $1 billion investment in Spain to enhance artificial intelligence and cloud computing. This investment will create a new cloud region in Madrid in partnership with Telefónica. The goal is to help Spanish businesses and the public sector with digital transformation and to meet European Union regulations.[27]\\n In January 2025, President Donald Trump announced Stargate, a joint venture by Oracle, OpenAI, SoftBank and investment firm MGX to invest $500 billion over four years in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US.[28]\\n Oracle designs, manufactures, and sells both software and hardware products and offers services that complement them (such as financing, training, consulting, and hosting services). Many of the products have been added to Oracle\\'s portfolio through acquisitions.\\n Oracle\\'s E-delivery service (Oracle Software Delivery Cloud) provides generic downloadable Oracle software and documentation.[29]\\n Oracle Corporation has acquired and developed the following additional database technologies:\\n Oracle Fusion Middleware is a family of middleware software products, including (for instance) application server, system integration, business process management (BPM), user interaction, content management, identity management and business intelligence (BI) products.\\n Oracle Secure Enterprise Search (SES), Oracle\\'s enterprise-search offering, gives users the ability to search for content across multiple locations, including websites, XML files, file servers, content management systems, enterprise resource planning systems, customer relationship management systems, business intelligence systems, and databases.\\n Released in 2008, the Oracle Beehive collaboration software provides team workspaces (including wikis, team calendaring and file sharing), email, calendar, instant messaging, and conferencing on a single platform. Customers can use Beehive as licensed software or as software as a service (\"SaaS\").[33]\\n Following a number of acquisitions beginning in 2003, especially in the area of applications, Oracle Corporation as of 2008[update] maintains a number of product lines:\\n Development of applications commonly takes place in Java (using Oracle JDeveloper) or through PL/SQL (using, for example, Oracle Forms and Oracle Reports/BIPublisher).[34][35] Oracle Corporation has started[36] a drive toward \"wizard\"-driven environments with a view to enabling non-programmers to produce simple data-driven applications.\\n Oracle Corporation works with \"Oracle Certified Partners\" to enhance its overall product marketing. The variety of applications from third-party vendors includes database applications for archiving, splitting and control, ERP and CRM systems, as well as more niche and focused products providing a range of commercial functions in areas like human resources, financial control and governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC). Vendors include Hewlett-Packard, Creoal Consulting, UC4 Software,[37] Motus,[38] and Knoa Software.[39]\\n Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) provides web-based monitoring and management tools for Oracle products (and for some third-party software), including database management, middleware management, application management, hardware and virtualization management and cloud management.[40]\\n The Primavera products of Oracle\\'s Construction & Engineering Global Business Unit (CEGBU) consist of project-management software.[41]\\n Oracle Corporation\\'s tools for developing applications include (among others):\\n Many external and third-party tools make the Oracle database administrator\\'s tasks easier.[42]\\n Oracle Corporation develops and supports two operating systems: Oracle Solaris and Oracle Linux.\\n Oracle Cloud is a cloud computing service offered by Oracle Corporation providing servers, storage, network, applications and services through a global network of Oracle Corporation managed data centers. The company allows these services to be provisioned on demand over the Internet.[48]\\n Oracle Cloud provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS) and Data as a Service (DaaS). These services are used to build, deploy, integrate and extend applications in the cloud. This platform supports open standards (SQL, HTML5, REST, etc.) open-source solutions (Kubernetes, Hadoop, Kafka, etc.) and a variety of programming languages, databases, tools and frameworks including Oracle-specific, free and third-party software and systems.[49]\\n On May 16, 2018, Oracle announced that it had acquired DataScience.com, a privately held cloud workspace platform for data science projects and workloads.[58]\\n In 2022 Oracle shared a $9 billion contract from the United States Department of Defense for cloud computing with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.[59]\\n In 1990, Oracle laid off 10% (about 400 people) of its work force because of accounting errors.[74] This crisis came about because of Oracle\\'s \"up-front\" marketing strategy, in which sales people urged potential customers to buy the largest possible amount of software all at once. The sales people then booked the value of future license sales in the current quarter, thereby increasing their bonuses.[75] This became a problem when the future sales subsequently failed to materialize. Oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice, and also settled (out of court) class-action lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings. Ellison stated in 1992 that Oracle had made \"an incredible business mistake\".[74]\\n In 1994, Informix overtook Sybase and became Oracle\\'s most important rival. The intense war between Informix CEO Phil White and Ellison made front-page news in Silicon Valley for three years. Informix claimed that Oracle had hired away Informix engineers to disclose important trade secrets about an upcoming product. Informix finally dropped its lawsuit against Oracle in 1997.[76] In November 2005, a book detailing the war between Oracle and Informix was published, titled The Real Story of Informix Software and Phil White. It gave a detailed chronology of the battle of Informix against Oracle, and how Informix Software\\'s CEO Phil White landed in jail because of his obsession with overtaking Ellison.\\n Once it had overcome Informix and Sybase, Oracle Corporation enjoyed years of dominance in the database market until the use of Microsoft SQL Server became widespread in the late 1990s and IBM acquired Informix Software in 2001 (to complement its Db2 database). Today[update] Oracle competes for new database licenses on UNIX, GNU, and Windows operating systems primarily against IBM\\'s Db2 and Microsoft SQL Server. IBM\\'s Db2 still[update] dominates the mainframe database market.\\n In 2004, Oracle\\'s sales grew at a rate of 14.5% to $6.2\\xa0billion, giving it 41.3% and the top share of the relational-database market (InformationWeek – March 2005), with market share estimated at up to 44.6% in 2005 by some sources.[77]\\nOracle Corporation\\'s main competitors in the database arena remain IBM Db2 and Microsoft SQL Server, and to a lesser extent Sybase and Teradata,[77] with free databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL also having a significant[78] share of the market. EnterpriseDB, based on PostgreSQL, has recently[update] made inroads[79] by proclaiming that its product delivers Oracle compatibility features[clarification needed] at a much lower price-point.\\n In the software-applications market, Oracle Corporation primarily[80][81] competes against SAP. On March 22, 2007, Oracle sued SAP, accusing them of fraud and unfair competition.[82]\\n In the market for business intelligence software, many other software companies—small and large—have successfully competed in quality with Oracle and SAP products. Business intelligence vendors can be categorized into the \"big four\" consolidated BI firms such as Oracle, who has entered BI market through a recent trend of acquisitions (including Hyperion Solutions), and the independent \"pure play\" vendors such as MicroStrategy, Actuate, and SAS.[83]\\n Oracle Financials was ranked in the Top 20 Most Popular Accounting Software Infographic by Capterra in 2014, beating out SAP and a number of their other competitors.[84]\\n From 1988, Oracle Corporation and the German company SAP AG had a decade-long history of cooperation, beginning with the integration of SAP\\'s R/3 enterprise application suite with Oracle\\'s relational database products. Despite the SAP partnership with Microsoft, and the increasing integration of SAP applications with Microsoft products (such as Microsoft SQL Server, a competitor to Oracle Database), Oracle and SAP continue their cooperation. According to Oracle Corporation, the majority of SAP\\'s customers use Oracle databases.[85]\\n In 2004, Oracle began to increase its interest in the enterprise-applications market (in 1989, Oracle had already released Oracle Financials). A series of acquisitions by Oracle Corporation began, most notably with those of PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems and Hyperion.\\n SAP recognized that Oracle had started to become a competitor in a markets where SAP had the leadership, and saw an opportunity to lure in customers from those companies that Oracle Corporation had acquired. SAP would offer those customers special discounts on the licenses for its enterprise applications.\\n Oracle Corporation would resort to a similar strategy, by advising SAP customers to get \"OFF SAP\" (a play on the words of the acronym for its middleware platform \"Oracle Fusion for SAP\"),[86] and also by providing special discounts on licenses and services to SAP customers who chose Oracle Corporation products.\\n Currently[update] Oracle and SAP (the latter through its recently acquired subsidiary TomorrowNow) compete in the third-party enterprise software maintenance and support market. On March 22, 2007, Oracle filed a lawsuit against SAP. In Oracle Corporation v. SAP AG Oracle alleged that TomorrowNow, which provides discount support for legacy Oracle product lines, used the accounts of former Oracle customers to systematically download patches and support documents from Oracle\\'s website and to appropriate them for SAP\\'s use.[87] Some analysts have suggested the suit could form part of a strategy by Oracle Corporation to decrease competition with SAP in the market for third-party enterprise software maintenance and support.[88][89]\\n On July 3, 2007, SAP admitted that TomorrowNow employees had made \"inappropriate downloads\" from the Oracle support website. However, it claims that SAP personnel and SAP customers had no access to Oracle intellectual property via TomorrowNow. SAP\\'s CEO Henning Kagermann stated that \"Even a single inappropriate download is unacceptable from my perspective. We regret very much that this occurred.\" Additionally, SAP announced that it had \"instituted changes\" in TomorrowNow\\'s operational oversight.[90]\\n On November 23, 2010, a U.S. district court jury in Oakland, California, found that SAP AG must pay Oracle Corp $1.3\\xa0billion for copyright infringement, awarding damages that could be the largest-ever for copyright infringement. While admitting liability, SAP estimated the damages at no more than $40\\xa0million, while Oracle claimed that they are at least $1.65\\xa0billion. The awarded amount is one of the 10 or 20 largest jury verdicts in U.S. legal history. SAP said they were disappointed by the verdict and might appeal.[91] On September 1, 2011, a federal judge overturned the judgment and offered a reduced amount or a new trial, calling Oracle\\'s original award \"grossly\" excessive.[92] Oracle chose a new trial.\\n On August 3, 2012, SAP and Oracle agreed on a judgment for $306 million in damages, pending approval from the U.S. district court judge, \"to save time and expense of [a] new trial\". After the accord has been approved, Oracle can ask a federal appeals court to reinstate the earlier jury verdict. In addition to the damages payment, SAP has already paid Oracle $120 million for its legal fees.[93]\\n Oracle Corporation produces and distributes the \"Oracle ClearView\" series of videos as part of its marketing mix.[107]\\n Oracle was ranked No. 82 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[109] According to Bloomberg, Oracle\\'s CEO-to-employee pay ratio is 1,205:1. The CEO\\'s compensation in 2017 was $108,295,023. Oracle is one of the approved employers of ACCA and the median employee compensation rate was $89,887.[110]\\n Oracle reported total carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions (direct + indirect) for the twelve months ending December 31, 2020 at 428 kilotonnes (+63/+17% year over year)[111] and plans to reduce emissions 26% by 2025 from a 2015 base year.[112]\\n In 2000, Oracle attracted attention from the computer industry and the press after hiring private investigators to dig through the trash of organizations involved in an antitrust trial against Microsoft.[116] The Chairman of Oracle Corporation, Larry Ellison, staunchly defended his company\\'s hiring of an East Coast detective agency to investigate groups that supported rival Microsoft Corporation during its antitrust trial, calling the snooping a \"public service\". The investigation reportedly included a $1,200 offer to janitors at the Association for Competitive Technology to look through Microsoft\\'s trash. When asked how he would feel if others were looking into Oracle\\'s business activities, Ellison said: \"We will ship our garbage to Redmond, and they can go through it. We believe in full disclosure.\"[117]\\n In 2002, Oracle Corporation marketed many of its products using the slogan \"Can\\'t break it, can\\'t break in\", or \"Unbreakable\".[118] This signified a claim of information security. Oracle Corporation also stressed the reliability of networked databases and network access to databases as major selling points.\\n However, two weeks after its introduction, David Litchfield, Alexander Kornbrust, Cesar Cerrudo and others demonstrated a whole suite of successful attacks against Oracle products.[119][120] Oracle Corporation\\'s chief security officer Mary Ann Davidson said that, rather than representing a literal claim of Oracle\\'s products\\' impregnability, she saw the campaign in the context of fourteen independent security evaluations[121] that Oracle Corporation\\'s database server had passed.\\n In 2004, then-United States Attorney General John Ashcroft sued Oracle Corporation to prevent it from acquiring a multibillion-dollar intelligence contract. After Ashcroft\\'s resignation from government, he founded a lobbying firm, The Ashcroft Group, which Oracle hired in 2005. With the group\\'s help, Oracle went on to acquire the contract.[122]\\n Computer Sciences Corporation, as the prime contractor, reportedly spent a billion dollars developing the Expeditionary Combat Support System for the United States Air Force. It yielded no significant capability, because, according to an Air Force source, the prime contractor \"was simply not up to the task of adapting\" the Oracle software, on which the system was based, to meet the specialized performance criteria.[123]\\n Oracle Corporation was awarded a contract by the State of Oregon\\'s Oregon Health Authority (OHA) to develop Cover Oregon, the state\\'s healthcare exchange website, as part of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. When the site tried to go live on October 1, 2013, it failed, and registrations had to be taken using paper applications until the site could be fixed.\\n On April 25, 2014, the State of Oregon voted to discontinue Cover Oregon and instead use the federal exchange to enroll Oregon residents.[124] The cost of switching to the federal portal was estimated at $5 million, whereas fixing Cover Oregon would have required another $78 million.\\n Oracle president Safra Catz responded to Cover Oregon and the OHA in a letter claiming that the site\\'s problems were due to OHA mismanagement, specifically that a third-party systems integrator was not hired to manage the complex project.[125][126]\\n In August 2014, Oracle Corporation sued Cover Oregon for breach of contract,[127] and then later that month the state of Oregon sued Oracle Corporation, in a civil complaint for breach of contract, fraud, filing false claims and \"racketeering\".[128] In September 2016, the two sides reached a settlement valued at over $100 million to the state, and a six-year agreement for Oracle to continue modernizing state software and IT.[129][130][131][132]\\n \\n In August 2022, a class action lawsuit was filed against Oracle by the law firm Lieff Cabraser. The lawsuit alleges that Oracle engaged in \"deliberate and purposeful surveillance of the general population via their digital and online existence\", specifically focusing on Oracle operating a surveillance machine which tracks in real-time and records indefinitely the personal information of hundreds of millions of people. The litigants argues that through such surveillance, the company violates the Federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act, California\\'s state constitution, the California Invasion of Privacy Act, competition law, and California Common Law.[133][134]\\n The lawsuit was settled in July 2024 when Oracle paid $115 million to some of its customers and agreed to stop tracking users.[135]\\n In 2023, Oracle was contracted by conservative think tank Heritage Foundation to construct a database of conservative employees to help staff a prospective Republican presidency in 2025, part of the Foundation\\'s Project 2025.[136][137]\\n In August 2011, The Wall Street Journal reported that Oracle was being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for paying bribes to government officials in order to win business in Africa, in contravention of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).[138]\\n In 2012 Oracle agreed to pay about $2 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC at the time alleged that the company\\'s Indian subsidiary structured transactions with foreign governments in a way that enabled them to hold about $2.2 million of the proceeds inside funds that could be used for unauthorized purposes and therefore was a violation of the FCPA.[139]\\n In September 2022, Oracle settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) without admitting or denying its findings, by agreeing to pay $23 million to settle the charges. The SEC announced that Oracle violated the FCPA between 2014 and 2019 when its subsidiaries in India, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) created slush funds to bribe foreign officials in order to win business.[140][141]\\n In 2017, a whistleblower notified the SEC and US Department of Justice, alleging possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in awarding of a R1 billion\\xa0(2015) (equivalent to R1.17 billion or US$88.54 million in 2018)[142] contract by National Treasury in 2015.[143]\\n In March 2024, South Africa\\'s Special Investigating Unit found that there were conflicts of interest, irregular processes, and non-compliance with policies and legislation, and said it would petition to blacklist Oracle in South Africa, cancel the contract and recover the money paid.[144]\\n In January 2010, Oracle completed its acquisition of Sun Microsystems—valued at more than $7\\xa0billion—a move that transformed Oracle from solely a software company to a manufacturer of both software and hardware. The acquisition was delayed for several months by the European Commission because of concerns about MySQL, but was unconditionally approved in the end.[145] In September 2011, U.S. State Department Embassy cables were leaked to WikiLeaks. One cable revealed that the U.S. pressured the E.U. to allow Oracle to acquire Sun.[146]\\n The Sun acquisition was closely watched by free software users and some companies, due to the fear that Oracle might end Sun\\'s traditional support of free projects.[147][148][149][150] Since the acquisition, Oracle has discontinued OpenSolaris and StarOffice, and sued Google over the Java patents Oracle acquired from Sun.[151][152]\\n On July 29, 2010, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) filed suit against Oracle Corporation alleging fraud. The lawsuit argues that the government received deals inferior to those Oracle gave to its commercial clients. The DoJ added its heft to an already existing whistleblower lawsuit filed by Paul Frascella, who was once senior director of contract services at Oracle.[153] It was settled in 2011.[154]\\n Oracle, the plaintiff, acquired ownership of the Java computer programming language when it acquired Sun Microsystems in January 2010.[155] The Java software includes sets of pre-developed software code to allow programs and apps to accomplish common tasks in a consistent manner. The pre-developed code is organized into separate \"packages\" which each contain a set of \"classes\". Each class contains numerous methods, which instruct a program or app to do a certain task. Software developers \"became accustomed to using Java\\'s designations at the package, class, and method level\".[156]\\n Oracle and Google (the defendant) tried to negotiate an agreement for Oracle to license Java to Google, which would have allowed Google to use Java in developing programs for mobile devices using the Android operating system. However, the two companies never reached an agreement. After negotiations failed, Google created its own programming platform, which was based on Java, and contained 37 copied Java packages as well as new packages developed by Google.[156]\\n In 2010, Oracle sued Google for copyright infringement for the use of the 37 Java packages.[156][155] The case was handled in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and assigned to Judge William Alsup (who taught himself how to code computers[157]).[155] In the lawsuit, Oracle sought between $1.4 billion and $6.1 billion.[155] In June 2011 the judge had to force Google through a judicial order to make public the details about Oracle\\'s claim for damages.[155]\\n \\nBy the end of the first jury trial (the legal dispute would eventually go on to another trial) the arguments made by Oracle\\'s attorneys focused on a Java function called \"rangeCheck\": The argument centered on a function called rangeCheck. Of all the lines of code that Oracle had tested—15 million in total—these were the only ones that were \\'literally\\' copied. Every keystroke, a perfect duplicate. – The Verge, 10/19/17[157] Although Google admitted to copying the packages, Judge Alsup found that none of the Java packages were covered under copyright protection, and therefore Google did not infringe.[156]\\n After the case was over, Oracle appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (750 F.3d 1339 (2014)).[156][158] On May 9, 2014, the appeals court partially reversed Judge Alsup\\'s decision, finding that Java APIs are copyrightable. API stands for \"application programming interface\" and are how different computer programs or apps communicate with each other. However, the appeals court also left open the possibility that Google might have a \"fair use\" defense.[158]\\n On October 6, 2014, Google filed a petition to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court denied the petition.[158]\\n The case was then returned to the U.S. District Court for another trial about Google\\'s fair use defense.[158] Oracle sought $9 billion in damages.[159] In May 2016, the trial jury found that Google\\'s use of Java\\'s APIs was considered fair use.[158]\\n In February 2017, Oracle filed another appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.[158] This time it was asking for a new trial because the District Court \"repeatedly undermined Oracle\\'s case\", which Oracle argued led the jury to make the wrong decision. According to ZDNet, \"For example, it [Oracle] says the court wrongly bought Google\\'s claim that Android was limited to smartphones while Java was for PCs, whereas Oracle contends that Java and Android both compete as platforms for smart TVs, cars, and wearables.\"[159]\\n On August 13, 2010, an internal Oracle memo leaked to the Internet cited plans for ending the OpenSolaris operating system project and community.[160] With Oracle planning to develop Solaris only in a closed source fashion, OpenSolaris developers moved to the Illumos and OpenIndiana project, among others.[161]\\n As Oracle completed their acquisition of Sun Microsystems in February 2010, they announced that OpenSSO would no longer be their strategic product.[162] Shortly after, OpenSSO was forked to OpenAM.[162] and will continue to be developed and supported by ForgeRock.\\n On September 6, 2010, Oracle announced that former Hewlett-Packard CEO Mark Hurd was to replace Charles Phillips, who resigned as Oracle co-president. In an official statement made by Larry Ellison, Phillips had previously expressed his desire to transition out of the company. Ellison had asked Phillips to stay on through the integration of Sun Microsystems Inc.[163] In a separate statement regarding the transition, Ellison said \"Mark did a brilliant job at HP and I expect he\\'ll do even better at Oracle. There is no executive in the IT world with more relevant experience than Mark.\"[164]\\n On September 7, 2010, HP announced a civil lawsuit against Mark Hurd \"to protect HP\\'s trade secrets\",[165] in response to Oracle hiring Hurd. On September 20, Oracle and HP published a joint press release announcing the resolution of the lawsuit on confidential terms and reaffirming commitment to long-term strategic partnership between the companies.[166]\\n A number of OpenOffice.org developers formed The Document Foundation and received backing by Google, Novell, Red Hat, and Canonical, as well as some others, but were unable to get Oracle to donate the brand OpenOffice.org, causing a fork in the development of OpenOffice.org with the foundation now developing and promoting LibreOffice. Oracle expressed no interest in sponsoring the new project and asked the OpenOffice.org developers that started the project to resign from the company due to \"conflicts of interest\". On November 1, 2010, 33 of the OpenOffice.org developers gave their letters of resignation.[167] On June 1, 2011, Oracle donated OpenOffice.org to the Apache Software Foundation.[168]\\n On June 15, 2011, HP filed a lawsuit in California Superior Court in Santa Clara, claiming that Oracle had breached an agreement to support the Itanium microprocessor used in HP\\'s high-end enterprise servers.[169] Oracle called the lawsuit \"an abuse of the judicial process\"[170] and said that had it known SAP\\'s Léo Apotheker was about to be hired as HP\\'s new CEO, any support for HP\\'s Itanium servers would not have been implied.[171]\\n On August 1, 2012, a California judge said in a tentative ruling that Oracle must continue porting its software at no cost until HP discontinues its sales of Itanium-based servers.[172][173] HP was awarded $3 billion in damages against Oracle in 2016.[174] HP argued Oracle\\'s canceling support damaged HP\\'s Itanium server brand. Oracle had announced that it would appeal both the decision and damages, but the decision stayed.[175][176]\\n On April 20, 2012, the US General Services Administration banned Oracle from the most popular portal for bidding on GSA contracts for undisclosed reasons. Oracle has previously used this portal for around four hundred million dollars a year in revenue.[177] Oracle previously settled a lawsuit filed under the False Claims Act, which accused the company of overbilling the US government between 1998 and 2006. The 2011 settlement forced Oracle to pay $199.5 million to the General Services Administration.[178]\\n On December 20, 2021, Oracle announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Cerner Corporation (now Oracle Health and Oracle Life Sciences) for approximately US$28.3 billion, creating a dedicated Industry Business Unit within the company. Cerner is the largest international supplier of health information technology, such as electronic health records (EHR), revenue cycle solutions, and biomedical device integration platforms, and has its headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri, US.[179] The deal closed in early July 2022 after receiving final approval from European regulators, making it Oracle\\'s largest acquisition and one of the largest in corporate history.[180]\\n Oracle\\'s purchase of Cerner is part of an effort to introduce Oracle products into the healthcare market, particularly in the United States although Oracle plans to expand Cerner\\'s global operations.[180] It mirrors closely to expansions of other large information technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon into the healthcare sector. Cerner already used Oracle solutions for its \"largest business and most important clinical system\", and Oracle announced its intention to integrate autonomous solutions such as the Oracle Voice Digital Assistant into Cerner clinical solutions. Oracle additionally has shared its plans to improve the usability and user experience of Cerner solutions.[179]\\n While the acquisition was originally met with mixed reactions by industry and investors, some industry experts have developed a more positive perception of the purchase. Cerner won a major contract in 2017 to supply its EHR software to the US Department of Defense and Veterans Administration Hospitals, which resulted in Cerner \"leaving its traditional base of hospital systems high and dry\" with delays in resolving issues and implementing innovations. Oracle\\'s acquisition allows for the larger corporation to support Cerner\\'s operations, with the goal of \"addressing basic operational issues... improving resiliency and usability\" in the short-term.[181] Some opinions have expressed longer-term concern, with Oracle Health expecting a decline in US-based sales in 2024, although an increase in global sales. Additionally, clients of Cerner have reported minimal improvements to the core system and a focus by Oracle on future advancements over resolving current issues.[182]\\n A September 2024 announcement by Oracle listed \"tens of thousands of engineering hours and millions of dollars\" of investments in the core clinical operations, and the release of the highly anticipated Oracle Clinical Digital Assistant, a generative AI system that automatically creates consultation documentation and proposes orders.[183]\\n On September 13, 2020, Bloomberg News reported that Oracle won a bidding war with other U.S.-based companies to take over social media company TikTok\\'s operations in the United States following the company\\'s pressure to forcibly be shut down by the Trump administration. Oracle was described as a \"trusted tech partner\" by TikTok, suggesting the deal may not be as structured as an outright sale.[184] On September 19, 2020, the Trump administration approved of the sale of TikTok\\'s US operations to Oracle \"[delaying] — by one week — restrictions that were originally to take effect\" on September 20 as indicated by the United States Department of Commerce.[185]\\n On February 10, 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing a source familiar with the matter, the Biden administration would be backing off from banning TikTok and shelving the sale of TikTok indefinitely, as the U.S. Commerce Department began reviewing whether or not Trump\\'s claims about TikTok can justify the attempts to ban it.[186]\\nOn February 27, 2023, Biden changed his \"indefinite\" stance on TikTok as he echoed Trump\\'s 2020 claims of disapproval. Biden said Federal agencies have thirty days to remove TikTok from all federal devices. Federal contractors must meet the same standard in ninety days. On March 8, 2024, Biden said he would sign a bipartisan bill banning TikTok in the United States if the Chinese company ByteDance didn\\'t divest.\\n Since December 2020, Oracle Corporation\\'s world headquarters has been located in Austin, Texas. Oracle has plans to build its largest office hub, with 8500 jobs, in Nashville, Tennessee within the next few decades.\\n Oracle has a large office complex located on the San Francisco Peninsula in the Redwood Shores area of Redwood City. This complex was home to Oracle world headquarters from 1989 to 2020.  It is located on the former site of Marine World/Africa USA, which moved from Redwood Shores to Vallejo in 1986. Oracle Corporation originally leased two buildings on the Oracle Parkway site, moving its finance and administration departments from the corporation\\'s former headquarters on Davis Drive, Belmont, California. Eventually, Oracle purchased the complex and constructed four additional buildings.\\n The distinctive Oracle Parkway buildings, nicknamed the Emerald City,[194] served as sets for the futuristic headquarters of the fictional company \"NorthAm Robotics\" in the Robin Williams film Bicentennial Man (1999).[195] The campus also represented the headquarters of Cyberdyne Systems in the movie Terminator Genisys (2015).[196]\\n Oracle Corporation operates in multiple markets and has acquired several companies which formerly functioned autonomously. In some cases these provided the starting points for global business units (GBUs) targeting particular vertical markets.[197] Oracle Corporation GBUs include:\\n On October 20, 2006, the Golden State Warriors and the Oracle Corporation announced a 10-year agreement in which the Oakland Arena would become known as the Oracle Arena.[198] The agreement ended after the 2018–2019 NBA season when the Warriors relocated to the Chase Center in San Francisco.[199]\\n Larry Ellison\\'s sailing team competes as Oracle Team USA. The team has won the America\\'s Cup twice, in 2010 (as BMW Oracle Racing)[200] and in 2013,[201] despite being penalized for cheating.[202][203]\\n Sean Tucker\\'s \"Challenger II\" stunt biplane is sponsored by Oracle and performs frequently at air shows around the US.[204]\\n In January 2019, the San Francisco Giants entered into a 20-year agreement to rename their stadium Oracle Park.[205]\\n From the 2022 Formula One season, Oracle signed a five-year deal worth $500m to become title sponsors of Red Bull Racing, after already being a sponsor effective from the 2021 season.[206] In 1994 and 1995, Oracle sponsored Benetton. It was revealed in July 2022 that NASCAR\\'s Joe Gibbs Racing team tried to sign a sponsorship with Oracle after Mars Inc. would announce they would leave JGR after the 2022 season, but the deal reportedly fell through.[207]\\n\\nFor appeals, questions and feedback about Oracle Forums, please email oracle-forums-moderators_us@oracle.com.

Additionally using the remove person information\\nfeature you can: Purge data from HCM Data Loader\\nstaging tables for terminated employees.  Perform staggered disposal of\\ndata for a terminated employee. For example, you can now purge Global\\nHR data first while retaining the payroll data for a longer time and\\npurge payroll data at a later date in the future using the same person\\nnumber reference.  Delete workers with canceled work\\nrelationships (rather than just terminated). To remove a person information, you need to have\\naccess to the following pages: Configure Person Information Removal\\nPolicies: Configure the business objects and its components that you\\nwant to remove and mask mandatory attributes. To access this page,\\nyou must have the Configure Person Information Removal Policies privilege\\n(HRC_CONFIGURE_PERSON_INFO_REMOVAL_POLICIES_PRIV). Remove Person Information: You\\ncan remove person information for specified people from this page.\\nWhen you submit the person information removal process, the data is\\nremoved as per the configuration defined in the associated person\\ninformation removal policy.  To grant access to\\na user for removing person information: On the Create Role page of the\\nSecurity Console, create a job role. On the Function Security Policy\\npage (Navigator > Security Console > Roles\\n> Create Role), add Configure Person Information Removal\\nPolicies (HRC_CONFIGURE_PERSON_INFO_REMOVAL_POLICIES_PRIV) privilege\\nto the role. On the Role Hierarchy page (Navigator > Security Console > Roles > Create Role, add Remove Person Information (ORA_HRC_REMOVE_PERSON_INFORMATION)\\nrole membership to access both Report and Remove modes. Add Generate\\nRemove Person Information (ORA_HRC_GENERATE_REMOVE_PERSON_INFORMATION_FILE)\\nrole membership to access Report mode alone. On the Data Roles and Security\\nProfiles page (Navigator > My Client > Workforce\\nStructures > Data Roles and Security Profiles), create\\na data role for the job role that you created. Add the data role to appropriate\\nusers. In addition, to execute the process, you also need\\nthese roles: HCM Data Loader is used to perform\\nthe data removal. You need HRC_LOAD_HCM_DATA_PRIV (Load HCM Data)\\nprivileges to do so. For UCM upload or download, you\\nneed HCM_DATALOADER_IMPORT_RWD to upload data for Human Capital Management\\nfile based Import, HCM_DATALOADER_EXPORT_RWD to download data from\\nHuman Capital Management file based Export, and \\'Transfer HCM File\\nfrom UCM and import into stage\\' (HRC_TRANSFER_HCM_FILE_AND_IMPORT_PRIV). Before you submit the Remove Person Information process, you must configure a policy\\n            that defines which business objects will have data removed or obfuscated. The Configure\\n            Person Information Removal Policies user interface includes business objects that are\\n            supported by this feature. You will see that records you can delete are highlighted and\\n            can only be selected for deletion in the policy configuration. Records that you can\\'t\\n            delete, you can configure at the attribute level, and identify the attributes that\\n            should be set to null or how an attribute should be masked (for attributes that cannot\\n            be set to NULL). Here are the attributes displayed on the page: CATEGORY: The Business Object the\\ntemplate was created for (for example: Worker). STATUS: The status of the template\\n(Draft, Active, Inactive). Only a template in Draft status can be\\nmodified. An active template can be only processed. An inactive template\\ncan\\'t be processed nor can it be modified.  CREATED BY: The user who created\\nthe template. LAST UPDATE DATE: The last date\\nand time the template was updated. To create templates and configure removal policies: Click Create to open the Create\\n                     Template window. Required fields are:  NAME: The name of the template.  CODE: The template code, defaults\\nto the name of the template. CATEGORY: The Business Object the\\ntemplate is created for: the options are Worker or Candidate. DESCRIPTION (optional): The user\\ncan also enter a description. Select one or more Business Objects. Under the Business Objects section,\\nsearch for a specific business object and select objects to process.\\nThe Components section, select the child objects under the selected\\nbusiness object. Use the Rules tab to configure\\npolicies. Most objects are configured for deletion, so no specific\\nrules are needed for those objects. You can configure rules for objects\\nif they contain attributes that can only be obfuscated and cannot\\nbe deleted. If you specify a generic value to include in a field,\\nyou can use any value except null. For example, the Person Last Name\\ncan\\'t be deleted, so it needs to be replaced by a static value. ZZZZZ\\nis the default. The Person Last Name will be replaced by this static\\nvalue appended by an internal identifier, to maintain the uniqueness\\nof this attribute and thus the data integrity. Notice the Search boxes\\nfor Attribute Names and Description.  When you submit the Remove Person Information process,\\nyou will need to identify the population of workers to discard and\\nselect the data removal policy to use. The policy determines which\\nbusiness objects are removed and how. Surrogate IDs are used to identify\\nthe records to discard, but the Person Information Removal framework\\nwill also include any other attributes that are mandatory when disposing\\ndata, such as ActionCode. Points to consider:   Ensure that the process is run\\non terminated workers only, with a termination date in the past. Deleted\\ndata can\\'t be recovered so proceed with caution.  The process details are stored\\n(for example, templates and person number) but the worker data as\\nper the template definition is removed. To start the Remove Person Information process, perform these\\n            steps: Click Submit Process\\n Enter a process name and select\\na template from the searchable list. Enter the Person Numbers, separated by commas, which are to\\n                  be deleted or obfuscated. Select a Process Mode: Report or\\n                     Remove. Here\\'s what you will see on the page after you submit\\nthe process: STATUS: Success or Error.  PROCESS MODE: Remove mode or Report\\nmode.  SUBMITTED BY: The user who submitted\\nthe process.  SUBMISSION DATE: The date the process\\nwas submitted. You can also use the View Process Details icon to\\nview different stages of the Person Information Removal process, as\\nwell as the corresponding log files: The log file details all steps\\ntaken in the process and the number of workers processed (for example,\\nNo of Employees Matching the Termination Criteria. If the Report mode was selected,\\nyou can use the Download Data File icon to download the .zip file\\ncontaining the .dat file, although this file can\\'t be used in another\\nHDL process. You must create new templates to prevent components from being missed out or to avoid\\n            errors during data disposal. \\nFunctional Privilege Name\\n \\nFunctional Privilege Code\\n Report Person Information Removal Processes \\nORA_HRC_REPORT_PERSON_INFO_REMOVAL_PROCESSES\\n \\nFunctional Privilege Name\\n \\nFunctional Privilege Code\\n Report Person Information Removal Templates \\nORA_HRC_REPORT_PERSON_INFO_REMOVAL_TEMPLATES\\n\\n']\n"
