# Automated Market Analyzer using Multi-Agent LLM

## Overview
This project leverages multiple language models (LLMs) to automate the process of analyzing competitors in the market. The system takes an input product query, searches for competitors using Google search, extracts relevant competitor information from web pages, and generates detailed competitor profiles. Using advanced LLMs, it analyzes these profiles, creates a comprehensive competitor analysis report, and saves the report as a PDF. The entire process is automated, helping businesses quickly assess market dynamics and competitor strategies.
